{"title": "Missiles fired from Yemen toward US warship that responded to attack on commercial tanker", "author": null, "timestamp": null, "content": "Two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi rebel-controlled Yemen toward a US warship in the Gulf of Aden, after the US Navy responded to a distress call from a commercial tanker that had been seized by armed individuals, the US military said Sunday. The tanker, identified as the Central Park, had been carrying a cargo of phosphoric acid when its crew called for help that “they were under attack from an unknown entity,” the US Central Command said in a  . Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday that under international maritime norms and laws, when there is a distress signal, “all vessels in the vicinity, are required to come and help and support.” Though Ryder added that there were three Chinese Navy vessels in the vicinity that “did not respond.” “Supposedly, those ships are there as part of a counter-piracy mission,” he said. “But they did not respond.” The incident comes after Iran-backed Houthi forces launched numerous attacks against US interests in the region, and Israel, since the October 7 Hamas attacks, as fears continue to ripple across the region that the Israel-Hamas war could widen. The Houthis are a  in Yemen that have been fighting a civil war in the country against a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia. They have voiced support for the Palestinians and organized protests in Yemen against Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Ryder told reporters on Monday that initial indications showed the attackers, who are currently being held on the Mason, are Somali. The USS Mason, a guided-missile destroyer, and allied ships from a counter-piracy task force that operates in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia responded to the call for help and “demanded release of the vessel” upon arrival, Central Command said. “Subsequently, five armed individuals debarked the ship and attempted to flee via their small boat,” said the statement posted on social media platform X. “The Mason pursued the attackers resulting in their eventual surrender,” the statement added. The individuals “attempted to access and take control of the ship, but when the combined task force responded they essentially fled.” Ryder said a Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) team from the Mason pursued the attackers and detained them, before going back to the Mason, clearing the ship and making contact with the crew ensuring they were safe. Less than two hours after the Navy’s VBSS team cleared the Central Park – at 1:41 a.m. local time on Monday – two ballistic missiles were fired from areas controlled by Houthi rebels in Yemen “toward the general location” of the USS Mason and Central Park, the statement said. “The missiles landed in the Gulf of Aden approximately ten nautical miles from the ships,” the statement said. The Mason was finishing its response to the Central Park’s distress call at the time of the missile launches. There was no damage or reported injuries from the Central Park or the Mason as a result, it added. Ryder declined on Monday to say if the missiles were believed to be targeting the Mason and Central Park. He said that while the Mason was tracking the missiles, they did not attempt to shoot them down and they “landed harmlessly in the water.” A statement from UK-based Zodiac Maritime, which manages the Central Park, said Sunday the Liberian-flagged chemical tanker was safe “and all of the crew, the vessel, and cargo are unharmed.” The tanker appears to have links to an Israeli-owned company; Zodiac Maritime   as a business belonging to Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s Ofer Global, though a spokesperson speaking on behalf of Zodiac Maritime, Janni Jarvinen, said Sunday that Zodiac “is not owned by Ofer Global.” Gen. Erik Kurilla, commander of US Central Command, said in the statement on Sunday that maritime domain security ‘is essential to regional stability.” “We will continue to work with allies and partners to ensure the safety and security of international shipping lanes,” Kurilla said. Since Hamas’ attack on Israel, the US has emphasized the priority of avoiding the conflict from spilling over into a broader conflict in the region, as US forces in Iraq and Syria have also been   by Iranian-backed groups. Among the groups Tehran supports, the Houthis are of particular concern as they are more independent of Iran than some others. Despite the escalation of attacks in the region, however, CNN   that intelligence showed Iran and its proxies have been thus far calibrating their responses to avoid direct conflict with US or Israel. But, over the last several weeks, the US has intercepted a number of cruise missiles and attack drones fired by the Houthis toward Israel or US assets. Last week, the USS Thomas Hudner shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Yemen while it was patrolling in the Red Sea. On November 15, the Hudner also   believed to have been heading toward the ship. Earlier this month, the Israeli military   an aerial attack of ballistic missiles and drones launched against targets in Israel. Houthi naval forces renewed a warning in a statement last week to ships in the Red Sea flying the Israeli flag, managed by Israeli companies or owned by Israelis. The group declared its intent to persist in military operations against Israeli ships and interests until Israel’s “aggression against Gaza stops.” The statement warned any military units providing protection to Israeli ships, stating that they would be considered legitimate targets for Houthi operations. Ryder said Monday that the Pentagon still assesses that the Israel-Hamas conflict has not yet spread into the region despite the recent attacks. “We largely see the conflict contained between Israel and Hamas. That’s not to say that you haven’t seen Iranian proxies attempt to take advantage to further their own goals,” Ryder said. “In the case of Iraq and Syria, you know, we’ve known that these groups for a long time have wanted to see us forces depart. But … no, we do not see that this has become a regional conflict. Although again, tensions are high, and it’s something that we’re taking seriously and attempting to ensure does not happen.” For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at "},

He was only the second lawmaker to be expelled from the House since the Civil War. referred to him as “one of the most deliberately outrageous members of Congress in history”. “Glib and voluble, he was known for wearing cowboy boots, skinny ties and out-of-date polyester suits and for a bouffant mound of hair that seemed to defy gravity,” Matt Schudel  The  referred to it as a “Planet of the Apes sort of hair helmet,” while   magazine wrote that it was “a creature from Lake Erie before it was cleaned up”. Before joining Congress, he served as the sheriff of Mahoning Country. He was put on trial in 1983 after prosecutors acquired a tape that included him saying he had accepted more than $100,000 in bribes from organised crime. But despite his complete lack of legal training, Traficant represented himself and managed to argue that he had collected the bribes as part of a sting operation and he was acquitted. He became known for his brief, rambling speeches on the House floor, often ending with a   reference: “Beam me up, Mr Speaker.” In 1997, he said: “Let us tell it like it is. When you hold this economy to your nosey, this economy does not smell so rosy. If there is any consolation to the American workers, I never heard of anyone committing suicide by jumping out of a basement window.” The following year, he said: “Russia gets $15bn in foreign aid from Uncle Sam. In exchange, Uncle Sam gets nuclear missiles pointed at our cities, two tape decks and three cases of vodka. Beam me up.” In 2002, Mr Traficant faced a 10-count felony indictment for racketeering, bribery and fraud, with federal prosecutors alleging that he required a number of his aides to pay him kickbacks each month of as much as $2,500 just to work for him. Yet other staff were required to bale hay on his Ohio farm or repair his Washington DC houseboat. He also faced allegations that he filed false tax returns and pushed businesses in his district to provide goods and services at no charge. He once again acted as his own attorney, but this time he was convicted on all counts. On 24 July 2002, he was removed from the House after a vote of 420 to one.

The vote will come nearly two weeks after the   published a  containing “substantial evidence” that Mr Santos allegedly broke various federal laws. The committee alleged that Mr Santos “knowingly” had his campaign committee file false and incomplete reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), used campaign funds for personal expenses, committed violations of the Ethics in Government Act and engaged in fraudulent conduct with a company he co-owned. Following the report, Representative Michael Guest, the chairman of the Ethics Committee, filed a motion to expel Mr Santos from Congress. Mr Santos,   said he is anticipating to be expelled. “I know I’m going to get expelled when this expulsion resolution goes to the floor,” Mr Santos said during a live Spaces event on X. The vote could happen as soon as Tuesday, 28 November, when members of the House return from their Thanksgiving holiday break. In order to expel Mr Santos, the House needs two-thirds of its members to vote in favour of Mr Guest’s motion. Earlier this month, a similar motion to expel Mr Santos brought by New York Republicans, failed on a 179 to 213 vote. However, this was before the House Ethics Committee report was released.  ,  Congressman  ’ tenure has been anything but dull — his rise to power and fall from grace have been equally mired in controversy. After less than two years in Congress, his list of lies and scandals appears to have finally grown too long for him to defend anymore, as   in 2024 after the release of a damning House Ethics Committee report. The committee said it found “substantial evidence” that Mr Santos had broken federal laws after finding “additional uncharged and unlawful conduct,” which included using campaign funds to make purchases at Hermes, Sephora and OnlyFans. In 2022, Mr Santos was elected as the Republican Party’s first openly gay, non-incumbent member of Congress, and touted himself as a living embodiment of the American dream. But he has since  , and now an accused criminal.  ,  Scandal-plagued   Rep   looks set to join an exclusive group of people as he has acknowledged that he’s likely to be expelled from  . “I know I’m going to get expelled when this expulsion resolution goes to the floor,”   said last week in a broadcast on the X social media platform, formerly known as  .

The latest blow of many to Mr Santos’s short yet tumultuous political career came in the form of a 56-page report from the House Ethics Committee released earlier this month which outlined “substantial evidence” that Mr Santos violated federal law. The report included allegations that Mr Santos used campaign money to pay for his personal expenses, such as Botox, and luxury purchases at Hermes and Ferragamo, as well as smaller sums spent on OnlyFans, food, parking, travel and rent. The House can consider the motion to expel Mr Santos put forward by ethics panel chair GOP Rep Michael Guest as soon as Tuesday when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break but when the vote may be taken up on the floor remains unclear. Mr Santos would be the first member of the House to be removed in modern times without first having been convicted of a crime.  ,  Late-night show hosts seized the moment to give  that revealed he spent campaign money on   and  .

On Saturday’s  , comedian Bowen Yang appeared on the show as the congressman as he was asked about the scandal by Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost. “George, this is serious. They’re calling for your expulsion,” Mr Jost said. “Well then, girl, ‘expul’ me!” Mr Yang’s Mr Santos replied.  ,  It might finally be over for Rep George Santos (R-NY) and, moreover, the House Republican conference might finally be out of excuses to keep him in the House. On Friday, Rep Michael Guest (R-MS), the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, filed a resolution to expel the embattled and disgraced freshman Republican. This   after the committee released its damning report detailing Mr Santos’s misdeeds. (My colleague John Bowden   a list of the most outrageous parts of the probe.) While many of the headlines noted how Mr Santos used campaign cash to pay for expensive meals, shopping trips to Sephora, Botox purchases and Only Fans sessions, fraud lies at the heart of the probe, specifically the fact he lied to the Federal Election Commission, with one of his staffers pretending to be a staffer for now-deposed speaker Kevin McCarthy. Similarly, he also lied about loans he made to his own campaign to qualify for assistance from the national Republican Party campaign apparatus. As a result, Mr Guest’s resolution could easily be said to be speaking for the entirety of the committee. It might easy to dismiss this effort by Mr Guest given that he is a conservative Republican from Mississippi who voted to overturn the 2020 election. Similarly, some may roll their eyes considering the House has already had two failed attempts to expel Mr Santos. But those efforts differ wildly from the current expulsion push. The first time came when Reps Dan Goldman and Ritchie Torres, both New York Democrats,   in May that the House majority immediately referred to the Ethics Committee.  ,  Despite his explosive criticism of the report, Mr Santos acknowledged that he may soon be exiting the House, having already said that he won’t seek re-election in 2024. “I’m not running for re-election, not because this was a damning report,” he said. “I’m not running for re-election because I don’t want to work with a bunch of hypocrites. “I know I’m going to get expelled when this expulsion resolution goes to the floor.” The   began its investigation in March 2023, after allegations of campaign finance misconduct and that Mr Santos lied about biographical details surfaced. Last week’s report found that the 35-year-old had violated ethics guidelines, the rules of the House and criminal laws, and that he had been aware that he was crossing the line. Mr Santos was indicted on 13 federal charges in May 2023, and in October, a superseding indictment brought another 10 criminal counts against him, bringing the total to 23.  ,  Mr Santos has survived two expulsion attempts already, but some members of the GOP have indicated that they will vote differently, following the publishing of the report. In an interview on X Spaces on Thursday, Mr Santos declared that “due process is dead” and described the report as “flawed”, before launching a searing attack on the document which he said was “an affront against my rights”. “The amount of hyperbole in this document is daunting. Every single person I’ve had discussions about it with – I have spoken to prominent Democrats who were troubled by the work of this committee,” he said. “It was designed to smear me, it was designed to force me out of my seat. That is what the intention of this report was. This report wasn’t a finding of facts.” He continued: “I will stand for expulsion. I want to see them set this precedent because this precedent sets a new era of due process, which means you are guilty until proven innocent. “We will take your accusations and use it to smear, to mangle, to destroy you and remove you from society. That is what they are doing with this. “This report is an affront against my rights and it should worry each and every single one of you guys.”  ,   says he expects to be expelled from the  , in the wake of a   accusing him of campaign finance violations.  said he felt like the “it girl” when he was first elected in 2022 – as the first openly gay Republican – and that everybody wanted him, “until nobody wanted me.” Last week  investigation into the embattled   was published. It stated that there was credible evidence to indicate that the Republican misused campaign funds for a wide range of personal expenses, committed fraud, and misled the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

The chamber can take up the motion on 28 November upon lawmakers’ return from Thanksgiving recess."},

Runyeon (@frankrunyeon)   ,  Hawthorn was testifying for the defense, which argues that various companies under the Trump Organization’s umbrella have produced reams of financial documents “that no one had a problem with,” as lawyer Clifford Robert put it. A lawyer for James’ office, Andrew Amer, stressed that the suit is about Trump’s statements of financial condition, calling the other documents “irrelevant.” Now finishing its second month, the trial is putting a spotlight on the real estate empire that vaulted Trump into public life and eventually politics. The former president and current Republican 2024 front-runner maintains that James, a Democrat, is trying to damage his campaign. Trump asserts that his wealth was understated, not overblown, on his financial statements. He also has stressed that the numbers came with disclaimers saying that they weren’t audited and that others might reach different conclusions about his financial position. During cross-examination, Hawthorn acknowledged that Trump’s financial statements could have been audited by the company, rather than just compiled, though he noted that auditing wasn’t required. Judge Arthur Engoron, who will decide the verdict in the non-jury trial, has already ruled that Trump and other defendants engaged in fraud. The current proceeding is to decide the remaining claims of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records. James wants the judge to impose over $300 million in penalties and to ban Trump from doing business in New York — and that’s on top of Engoron’s pretrial order that a receiver take control of some of Trump’s properties.

A law first crafted in the nation’s infancy would give Trump as commander in chief almost unfettered power to do so, military and legal experts said in a series of interviews.

This is the third week of the defence case and on the witness stand today is Mark Hawthorn, the COO of Trump's hotels division. Mr Hawthorn, a CPA who formerly worked at Ernst & Young, previously testified in New York Attorney General Letitia James’s case for the state, saying he was never directly involved in the creation of Mr Trump's financial statements. As with other witnesses, the former president’s defence team turned questioning toward the argument that accountant Donald Bender of outside firm Mazars was fully aware of how things were valued by the company and did not raise any red flags.

I’m seriously looking at alternatives,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. \"We had a couple of Republican Senators who campaigned for six years against it, and then raised their hands not to terminate it,” the former president also wrote. “It was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!” By 2022’s midterm elections, Republicans had largely dropped eliminating Obamacare it as a policy goal, having realised that pushing to take healthcare away from millions of Americans was not a vote winner. President Joe Biden’s 2024 re-election campaign seized on the potential revival of the policy. Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement: “40 million people — more than 1 in 10 Americans — have health insurance today because of the Affordable Care Act and Donald Trump just said he would try to rip it away if he returns to power. He was one vote away from getting it done when he was president — and we should take him at his word that he’ll try to do it again.” Mr Trump would have to be elected president in 2024 with a Republican-controlled Congress in place in order to pursue eliminating the Affordable Care Act. The law was signed by then-president Barack Obama in 2010 with his vice president, Mr Biden, by his side. In 2017, an effort by then-president Trump and a Republican-led Congress fell short of repealing the law.

The problem is that the loudest voices are giving away the game and revealing this is not only an attempt to whitewash the events but rather to run interference and defend Mr Trump.  ,  A wave of death threats and antisemitic and homophobic messages were sent to the judge overseeing Donald Trump’s fraud trial, as well as his chief clerk, according to a state court filing this week. A filing to support New York Justice Arthur Engoron’s opposition to a freeze on a gag order in the case includes a statement from the court’s top security official, who has collected “hundreds of threats, disparaging and harassing comments and antisemitic messages” that followed the former president’s harassment. Federal prosecutors – who are seeking a separate gag order – shared those threats with the federal appeals court judges who will decide whether Mr Trump should be gagged in his election interference case. But on Friday, the former president’s attorneys dismissed those threats as “irrelevant”.

She ressed a judge to revoke a bond order for one of Trump’s co-defendants who repeatedly posted about several people involved the case despite the terms of his release prohibiting him from communication with witnesses or co-defendants “directly or indirectly”. The appearance from Ms Willis previewed the arguments, evidence and list of witnesses expected to testify in the upcoming trial, among several criminal cases surrounding the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination for president. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee declined to send Harrison Floyd back to jail and directed the parties to draft an order that reels in his public statements.  ,  Georgia’s Supreme Court rejected a commission’s authority to remove state prosecutors, which Republican officials had hoped to use against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, whose sprawling racketeering case against Donald Trump and his co-defendants is steering towards a criminal trial in Atlanta. A ruling from the court on Wednesday surrounding the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission – which was established by Republican Governor Brian Kemp earlier this year – argued it does not have the constitutional authority to do so. Mr Kemp said the committee was created to remove local prosecutors who did not fulfill their “constitutional and statutory duties” or were “driven by out-of-touch politics.” Republican lawmakers in the state intended to wield that authority against Ms Willis and other Democratic elected prosecutors. But the state’s highest court has “grave doubts that we have the constitutional power to take any action on the draft standards and rules,” according to the ruling. DeKalb County District Attorney Sherry Boston, among several Georgia prosecutors who sued to overturn the commission, said they are “pleased the justices have taken action to stop this unconstitutional attack on the state’s prosecutors.” “While we celebrate this as a victory, we remain steadfast in our commitment to fight any future attempts to undermine the will of Georgia voters and the independence of the prosecutors who they choose to represent them,” she added.  ,  Elise Stefanik is among congressional Republicans defending the former president in the court of public opinion as he faces a potentially crushing judgment in his civil fraud trial.

A former associate is suing him for $10,000, adding to the mountain of debt the former New York City mayor and Trump attorney is facing. BST & Co. CPAs, LLP, an accounting firm based in Latham, New York, claims he had the company conduct an appraisal of his business interests while he separated from his wife, Judith Nathan, without paying them. Including interest, the firm now seeks to recover about $25,000. Michelle Del Rey reports:  ,  Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen, who   in the civil fraud trial in New York, said his former boss is “seeing himself lose every single day” he is in court. “That case is going to financially put Trump on his a**, not to mention it is going to unwind the Trump corporation, at least here in the state,” he said  . “It becomes what’s known as the death spiral where you’re no longer able to operate,” he added. Judge Arthur Engoron, who is overseeing the case, already found Trump liable for fraud, in a pretrial judgment that effectively dissolved his ability to do business in the state. That part of the order has been temporarily frozen on appeal. Trump has called the judgment “the corporate death penalty” against him, as he continues to base his campaign a conspiracy theory that the multiple criminal and civil cases against him are intended to keep him away from the White House. In his two-day testimony in the fraud trial, Cohen claimed he was “tasked by Mr Trump to increase the total assets based upon a number that he arbitrarily elected” for his statement of financial condition, the documents at the centre of the case. Cohen and convicted former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg were instructed to “reverse engineer the various different asset classes – increase those assets – in order to achieve the number that Mr Trump had tasked us with,” Cohen said. Asked by counsel for the attorney general’s office what that number was, Cohen replied: “Whatever number Mr Trump told us to.” Under questioning from Trump’s attorneys, Cohen agreed that his former boss never explicitly asked him to “inflate” the figures at the centre of the case. “Donald Trump speaks like a mob boss,” Cohen testified. “He tells you what he wants without specifically telling you … That’s what I was referring to.”  ,  Trump reportedly told Argentina’s far-right president-elect Javier Milei that he plans to travel to meet him, Mr Milei’s office said on Thursday. The office did not provide a date. Mr Milei is scheduled to be inaugurated on 10 December. “The president-elect received a call last night from the former president of the United States, Donald Trump, who congratulated him and pointed out his triumph by a wide margin in last Sunday’s election had a great impact on a global scale,” according to a statement from Mr Milei’s office. In a video on Tuesday, Trump said: “I am very proud of you. You will turn your country around and truly make Argentina great again.” President Joe Biden, meanwhile, also has called Mr Milei following his election victory to discuss “the strong relationship between the United States and Argentina on economic issues, on regional and multilateral cooperation, and on shared priorities, including advocating for the protection of human rights, addressing food insecurity and investing in clean energy.” Meet South America’s incoming new MAGA-like leader:"},

{"title": "Young Thug trial: Judge rips lawyers in YSL Rico case", "author": null, "timestamp": null, "content": "The hotly-anticipated trial of the rapper   is underway in a courtroom in Atlanta, Georgia, following almost a year of delays. Back in May 2022, Young Thug, real name Jeffery Williams, was arrested and charged in a Fulton County District Attorney   – who is using the same law to prosecute   over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state – accused the suspects of being part of a criminal street   named YSL. According to prosecutors, the gang is responsible for a series of violent crimes, including murders, shootings, carjackings and  . Young Thug has denied the accusations and insisted that YSL is simply Young Thug’s record label – Young Slime Life. After several defendants took plea deals or had their cases severed, the Grammy Award-winning rapper and five others are finally going on trial. The trial is off to a rocky start. A late juror delayed the trial by an hour and a half. The prosecution faced three objections from the defence, all of which were sustained, and the defence motioned for a mistrial, but the bid was denied. Opening statements to begin today Young Thug charged in sprawling RICO case What is YSL?  ,  The case hinges on Donovan Thomas, whom the indictment describes as “an associate of a rival gang.” He was killed in a drive-by shooting on 10 January 2015. Fulton County DA Fani Willis described Thomas’s killing led to a gang war that “created violence like Atlanta has never seen.” The prosecutor accused Jeffery Williams aka Young Thug of renting a car, despite owning a car, that other YSL members used to “notoriously gun down Donovan Thomas.” The defence argued that there are “no eyewitnesses” of Thomas’ killing and insinuated that Spencer Wright aka “fabricated” seeing the killing, as he pointed out that Mr Wright initially used a false name — Nicholas Robinson — when talking to investigators. Then, using Mr Wright’s word, detectives got warrants for his client, Shannon Stillwell, among others, he said.  ,  “There were no eyewitnesses” of the murder of Donovan Thomas, Max Schardt of the defence team told the jury. “No one had been charged for nine months and nine days.” The indictment describes Thomas as an “associate of a rival gang.” He said there is surveillance footage of the incident, which jurors will be able to watch. The Fulton County District Attorney has said that Thomas’s killing led to a gang war that “created violence like Atlanta has never seen,” therefore much of the case connects back to this drive-by death.  ,  Defence attorney Max Schardt started by saying his client, Shannon Stillwell, “is an innocent man.” Mr Schardt said that Shannon “trying to make it in rap, sold marijuana” and pleaded guilty. He tried to separate Mr Stillwell’s past as being totally separate from YSL. He said he had done his time for the drug charges. “We’re not hiding that Shannon Stillwell sold drugs...or was found in possession of a firearm. These are his pasts and his truths,” he added. “But the evidence will show that Shannon’s decisions had nothing to do with YSL or any other organisation.”  ,  Today was a rocky start to the hotly anticipated trial of rapper Young Thug, aka Jeffery Williams, and 28 other defendants who are allegedly involved in the criminal gang YSL; the defence argues that YSL is merely a record label. The trial was immediately delayed by an hour and a half, as the court was waiting for one late juror. Then, the prosecution started its opening statements, which were met with numerous objections, and some disagreement over whether the prosecution provided the defence with slides it was showing the jurors. The jury then had to leave, came back briefly, before being let off for a lunch recess. After the court returned from lunch, the judge snapped at attorneys from both sides for having “wasted two hours.” Hours after she began, prosecutor Adriane Love resumed her opening statement, which focused on depicting how YSL operates and portraying Mr Williams as the ringleader. She also already incorporated some of the defendants’ lyrics — the inclusion of which was itself a heated topic ahead of the trial.  ,  Ms Love emphasised that law enforcement were “happening upon the lyrics while trying to solve a murder.” She read some of defendant Shannon Stillwell’s lyrics, which included a reference to murder after he was released on bond for the murder of Donovan Thomas, she said.  ,  YSL uses a certain set of symbols and other idiosyncrasies to identify themselves, according to Prosecutor Love. These included: substituting the letter “C” with the letter “B,” like “Bleveland” vs Cleveland or “Bhris” vs Chris using certain emojis: Green Heart, Green Snake, Blowing Nose, and Green Vomit emojis using certain hand signs  ,  “The only time...that members of YSL don’t want to call themselves and acknowledge hat they are in fact a gang is when it would be to their detriment. The evidence will show that they are loudly and proudly promoting their criminal activities,” Ms Love said during her opening statement.  ,  “We didn't chase any of the lyrics to solve any murders. Law enforcement in Fulton County chased the murders and found the lyrics,” Ms Love said. The prosecutor then started quoting a Young Thug song. The use of lyrics from rappers associated with YSL and Young Thug in the case has been an ongoing point of contention. Earlier this month, the judge ruled that he would allow prosecutors to introduce 17 sets of lyrics — so long as they can demonstrate that those lyrics are related to crimes that the rapper and other defendants are accused of committing. The defence team had argued against the lyrics’ inclusion in the case, arguing they are constitutionally protected speech. “The lyrics [defendants] chose to speak...bore a very eerie significance to real life,” Ms Love added.  ,  Young Thug aka Jeffery Williams is being painted as the head of YSL by the state. “The defendant Jeffery Williams’ words and actions betrayed his participation in the conspiracy,” Ms Love said. He rented a car, despite owning a car, that other YSL members used to “notoriously gun down Donovan Thomas,” the prosecutor added.  ,  The prosecutor is painting Jeffery Williams aka Young Thug as the “leader” of YSL. She said that a machine gun was found at the rapper’s home. Ms Love said there will be no evidence to show “any need for that.” She repeated that YSL’s goal is to “maintain dominance and control” of the area.  ,  Prosecutor Love said defendant Rodalius Ryan’s youth and life were “swallowed up in the crater created by YSL.” Twelve hours after killing Jamari Holmes, Mr Ryan posted on his Instagram predicting that YSL ‘makes the news,’ she said, adding that he was “promoting the gang.”  ,  Many hours later, due to a series of objections and a recess for lunch break, the prosecution resumed its opening statement. A conspiracy requires “just one overt act, so you will see evidence of several overt acts...that were done by these defendants” and other unnamed people “to further the goal of the conspriacy,” Ms Love said. She said these “steps” taken that had nothing to do” with a record label.”  ,  Young Thug’s racketeering conspiracy charge and two gang charges each carry a penalty of five to 20 years in prison. The other five charges also carry potential prison time.  ,  The judge asked one defence lawyer to have his client ‘put on his shoes.’ It’s unclear which defendant the judge was referring to when he made the strange request. The jury was supposed to return at 1.45pm after a lunch break but it has been more than 45 minutes and the jurors have yet to reenter the courtroom. In the meantime, the judge has snapped at the attorneys for having “wasted” nearly two hours as both sides have yet to complete their opening statements.  ,  “We have wasted almost two hours trying to get this stuff done,” the judge said. He then banned either side from using Powerpoints after a debacle after the state allegedly didn’t provide updates it made to its slideshow, shown to jurors in opening arguments, to the defence. Both sides argued for the judge to change his mind. The jurors have yet to return to the courtroom as the conversation between attorneys and the judge continues.  ,  “If you don’t listen to the court, you’re going to get into hot water,” he said, clearly frustrated with both sides.  ,  The defence team has yet to give opening statements today. But in numerous court filings, the rapper’s attorneys have said that he is innocent of all crimes charged in the indictment. They argue YSL is simply a record label. Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams, has pleaded not guilty.  ,  Opening arguments were supposed to restart after lunch at 1.45pm. This trial is only on its first day and has already been plagued by a series of objections and delays, including a juror showing up over an hour late.  ,  The indictment portrays Young Thug as the leader of the criminal gang, which was responsible for multiple violent crimes, including murders, shootings and carjackings. Prosecutors say the rapper also used his music and social media posts to promote the gang, He is also alleged to have committed multiple crimes that he has not been charged with. While he is not being charged for such “overt acts”, they lend credence to the allegation that the group of defendants were together engaged in a criminal conspiracy. Brian Steel, Young Thug’s lawyer, told  : “Mr Williams came from an incredibly horrible upbringing, and he has conducted himself throughout his life in a way that is just to marvel at. He’s committed no crime whatsoever.”  ,  The use of lyrics from rappers associated with YSL and Young Thug in the case has been an ongoing point of contention. Earlier this month, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville ruled that he would allow prosecutors to introduce 17 sets of lyrics, as long as they can show that the lyrics are related to crimes that the rapper and other defendants are accused of committing. Defence attorneys had asked the judge to exclude them, arguing the lyrics are constitutionally protected speech and would be unfairly prejudicial.  ,  After a series of delays and objections, the judge sent the jury to lunch until 1.45pm. The latest delay occurred after the defence team took issue with one of the slides that the prosecutors showed the jury, saying they hadn’t seen the slide ahead of the trial, which violated the judge’s order last week. The judge then required the prosecution to send over all of the slides it planned to use while the defence reviewed it, causing another delay.  ,  Young Thug has been in prison since his arrest in May 2022. Earlier this month, a jury was finally selected after almost one year – with over 2,000 people having been summoned to possibly serve. Now, opening statements in the trial are set to begin on 27 November.  reports that the trial could end up being the longest in Georgia’s history.  ,  The YSL Rico trial has been anything but dull — even on its first day of opening arguments. A late juror delayed the trial by an hour and a half. Then, during its opening statement, the prosecution faced three objections from the defence, all of which were sustained. The defence motioned for a mistrial, because it hadn’t seen all of the slides that the prosecution was showing the jury, but the bid was denied. The judge scolded both sides for the turbulent trial start: “I’m not happy about any of this.”  ,  The judge said he denied the motion. Mr Steel then argued that he didn’t receive the displays used by the prosecution ahead of the trial. Ms Love said it was an “inadvertent omission.” The judge then got testy. He said “I'm not happy about any of this,” as the jury was delayed again and the defence’s sidebar earlier. The judge instructed prosecutors to hand over any additional slides that she hasn’t provided the defence team in the next five minutes. The defence team now has a few minutes to review the unseen slides.  ,  Mr Williams’ defence attorney Brian Steel is moving for a mistrial because prosecutor Adriane Love’s team presented a slide on the screen, shown to jurors, that indicated that Mr Steel represented Rodalius Ryan in another case.  ,  The prosecution said that it took the judge four hours to read the 65-count indictment last year. Young Thug is charged with eight of those 65 counts.  ,  Adriane Love, the state prosecutor, explained the history of YSL and how it operates, emphasising the rapper’s leadership role. YSL came from ROC [Raised on Cleaveland] Crew. Ms Love said that Mr Williams, aka Young Thug, became one of its leaders. “There will be no evidence of a written contract...because this was a group of people...who used common colors and symbols to communicate to one another and identify to the rest of the world,” Ms Love explained. The associates of YSL moved like a pack, “with the defendant Jeffery Williams as its head.” The evidence will show that “YSL checks all the boxes of being a criminal street gang,” she said.  ,  Prosecutor Adriane Love opened up with quote from  “YSL operated as a pack,” she said. For 10 years and counting, the group calling itself Young Slime Life dominated the Cleaveland Avenue community of Fulton County. They created a crater...that sucked the youth, the innocence, and even the lives of some of its members.”  ,  Born in 1991 as Jeffrey Lamar Williams, Young Thug is an Atlanta-born rapper. He also goes by the name Slime. After starting his career at the age of 19, he signed with Gucci Mane’s record label, and went on to become one of the most influential artists on the contemporary hip-hop and trap music scene. His first two albums “So Much Fun”, in 2019, and “Punk”, in 2021, debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, as did his 2021 joint compilation album with Gunna, “Slime Language 2”. Young Thug has also featured in multiple collaborations that have earned him several number one hits. These include guest spots on Camila Cabello’s   in 2018, Travis Scott and MIA’s   in 2020 and Drake and Future’s   in 2021, all of which topped the Billboard Hot 100. He also co-wrote the hit song   with Childish Gambino, real name Donald Glover, which became the first hip-hop track to win Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards in 2019.  ,  More than 6,500 people have tuned in to watch the live RICO trial of Young Thug. Opening arguments are now beginning after an hour and a half delay due to a juror having car problems.  ,  Judge Ural Glanville is reading the charges brought against each of the 28 defendants. All of the defendants have pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, the judge said.  ,  The indictment portrays Young Thug as the leader of the criminal gang, which was responsible for multiple violent crimes, including murders, shootings and carjackings. Prosecutors say the rapper also used his music and social media posts to promote the gang, He is also alleged to have committed multiple crimes that he has not been charged with. While he is not being charged for such “overt acts”, they lend credence to the allegation that the group of defendants were together engaged in a criminal conspiracy. Brian Steel, Young Thug’s lawyer, told  : “Mr Williams came from an incredibly horrible upbringing, and he has conducted himself throughout his life in a way that is just to marvel at. He’s committed no crime whatsoever.”  ,  After the opening arguments were delayed, due to one juror’s absence, all jurors are now present, the judge said. The trial is now set to begin.  ,  Nearly 10 months after jury selection began, a panel of Georgia citizens was selected Wednesday for the trial of rapper Young Thug and several other people accused of participating in a criminal street gang responsible for violent crimes. The Atlanta-based artist, whose given name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, and six others are now set to stand trial beginning Nov. 27 after prosecutors and defense attorneys chose 12 jurors and six alternates, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The trial is expected to last months. The sprawling indictment returned in May included more than two dozen defendants. But eight — including rapper Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens — took plea deals and 12 others will be tried separately, the newspaper reported. ...  ,  “YSL is a criminal street gang that started in late 2012 in the Cleveland Avenue area of Atlanta, Georgia. YSL claims affiliation with the national Bloods gang. YSL’s founders were Jeffery Williams AKA ‘Young Thug,’ AKA ‘Slime,’ Walter Murphy AKA “DK,” and Trontavious Stephens AKA ‘Tick,’ AKA ‘Slug.’ Jeffery Williams, an Atlanta-based hip-hop artist, made YSL a well-known name by referring to it in his songs and on social media.”  ,  Judge Ural Glanville said that the opening arguments are delayed as one juror has not shown up — after it took 11 months to pick the jury. They are trying to “locate” her, he said.  ,  Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis — the same prosecutor working on the former president’s Georgia case — accused Yung Thug aka Jeffrey Williams, of being in a “position of leadership” in Young Slime Life, which she claims is a criminal street gang in a 56-count indictment. The rapper has denied the claims; he and 27 others were charged with conspiracy to violate Georgia’s RICO Act. Young Thug has been incarcerated since 9 May 2022. According to   he has filed for bond four times but has been denied three times because the judge thinks the rapper poses a danger to the community.  ,  The use of lyrics from rappers associated with YSL and Young Thug in the case has been an ongoing point of contention. Earlier this month, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville ruled that he would allow prosecutors to introduce 17 sets of lyrics, as long as they can show that the lyrics are related to crimes that the rapper and other defendants are accused of committing. Defence attorneys had asked the judge to exclude them, arguing the lyrics are constitutionally protected speech and would be unfairly prejudicial. “The question is not rap lyrics. The question is gang lyrics,” prosecutor Mike Carlson said, during a pre-trial hearing. “These are party admissions. They happen to come in the form of lyrics.” Mr Carlson had argued that First Amendment speech protections do not apply because the defendants are not being prosecuted for their lyrics. Instead, he said, the lyrics refer to the criminal act or the criminal intent related to the charges. Another prosecutor, Simone Hylton, also separated the lyrics into three categories: those that prove the existence of YSL as an enterprise, those that show the gang’s behaviour and actions, and those that show that Young Thug is a leader of the gang.  ,  YSL — Young Slime Life is a record label and alleged criminal street gang. The YSL members named in the indictment are charged with conspiracy to violate Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The act is similar to its federal counterpart, which is used to convict large-scale organisations such as the mafia. According to the indictment, associates of YSL “conspired to associate together and with others for the common purposes of illegally obtaining money and property through a pattern of racketeering activity”. It claims that YSL members were involved in murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, theft, drug dealing, carjacking, and witness intimidation. Other activities include “the posting of messages, images, videos and songs, demonstrating allegiance to the enterprise and willingness to engage in violence on its behalf”. Prosecutors claim they can show that some of the group’s lyrics are related to crimes that they are accused of committing.  ,  Young Thug has been in prison since his arrest in May 2022. Earlier this month, a jury was finally selected after almost one year – with over 2,000 people having been summoned to possibly serve. There has been numerous other challenges in the courtroom – from getting the defendants housed in different jails to court each day to dealing with contraband in the courtroom and, wildly, the arrests of a defence attorney and a courtroom deputy. Now, opening statements in the trial are set to begin today. It could be the longest trial in Georgia’s history.  ,  The indictment portrays Young Thug as the leader of the criminal gang, which was responsible for multiple violent crimes, including murders, shootings and carjackings. Prosecutors say the rapper also used his music and social media posts to promote the gang, He is also alleged to have committed multiple crimes that he has not been charged with. While he is not being charged for such “overt acts”, they lend credence to the allegation that the group of defendants were together engaged in a criminal conspiracy. Brian Steel, Young Thug’s lawyer, told  : “Mr Williams came from an incredibly horrible upbringing, and he has conducted himself throughout his life in a way that is just to marvel at. He’s committed no crime whatsoever.”  ,  The YSL members named in the indictment are charged with conspiracy to violate Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The act is similar to its federal counterpart, which is used to convict large-scale organisations such as the mafia. According to the indictment, associates of YSL “conspired to associate together and with others for the common purposes of illegally obtaining money and property through a pattern of racketeering activity”. It claims that YSL members were involved in murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, theft, drug dealing, carjacking, and witness intimidation. Other activities include “the posting of messages, images, videos and songs, demonstrating allegiance to the enterprise and willingness to engage in violence on its behalf”. Prosecutors claim they can show that some of the group’s lyrics are related to crimes that they are accused of committing. The indictment portrays Young Thug as the leader of the gang. Through these activities and more the gang aimed to “preserve, protect, and enhance the reputation, power and territory” of the enterprise, prosecutors said.  ,  It depends who you ask. YSL is Young Thug’s own record label – Young Slime Life. Artists on his record label are considered part of the “Slime Family,” and a compilation album, “Slime Language 2,” rose to number one on the US charts in April 2021. Its artists include Gunna and Lil Keed, though several contemporary artists, including Future, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, Lil Baby, and Travis Scott have also expressed allegiance to YSL without being contractually signed. However, according to prosecutors, YSL is actually a “criminal street gang”, which started out in the Cleveland Avenue area of Atlanta and claims affiliation to the national Bloods gang. According to a sprawling 88-page indictment, the members of YSL use “a variety of identifiers including colours, clothing, tattoos, and hand signs” to show their allegiance to the group. The most predominant colours used by members of YSL are red for Bloods and green for Slime. Defence attorneys meanwhile insist that YSL is just a music label.  ,  Born in 1991 as Jeffrey Lamar Williams, Young Thug is an Atlanta-born rapper. He also goes by the name Slime. After starting his career at the age of 19, he signed with Gucci Mane’s record label, and went on to become one of the most influential artists on the contemporary hip-hop and trap music scene. His first two albums “So Much Fun”, in 2019, and “Punk”, in 2021, debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, as did his 2021 joint compilation album with Gunna, “Slime Language 2”. Young Thug has also featured in multiple collaborations that have earned him several number one hits. These include guest spots on Camila Cabello’s   in 2018, Travis Scott and MIA’s   in 2020 and Drake and Future’s   in 2021, all of which topped the Billboard Hot 100. He also co-wrote the hit song   with Childish Gambino, real name Donald Glover, which became the first hip-hop track to win Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards in 2019. Young Thug is also noted for his style, with a 2016   article describing him as “a leader of the psychedelic fashion movement of rap hippies”. “He is unapproachable. He radiates volatility. I can’t even imagine him making actual, on-purpose eye contact with another human,” the article states.  ,  The trial of Atlanta-based rapper Young Thug is set to begin in Georgia, nearly 11 months after jury selection first began. The chart-topping artist, along with several others, is accused of violent crimes and racketeering as part an alleged criminal street gang named YSL. Jury selection for the trial began in January, but faced numerous challenges – from getting the defendants housed in different jails to court each day to dealing with contraband in the courtroom and – wildly – the arrests of a defence attorney and a courtroom deputy. The saga in the courtroom has led to lengthy delays in the trial, which is expected to last months, getting under way. Finally, opening statements are scheduled to begin on Monday 27 November.

Blinken has spent much of the last month-and-a-half deeply engaged on the Gaza crisis, making two trips to the Middle East. Now, amid signs that a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas due to expire on Monday may be extended, Blinken is departing for Brussels for a NATO foreign ministers meeting. In Brussels, the alliance will reaffirm its support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, explore ways of easing tensions between Kosovo and Serbia and look at preparations for NATO’s 75th anniversary next year.  ,   has unveiled what he calls  ’s new strategy to counter Western dominance of the field of artifical intelligence, claiming that new   models “cancel Russian culture”. The president addressed an AI conference in Moscow on Friday where he said Russian investment in AI development was being increased across all sectors. Citing the example of Gazprom Neft, Mr Putin said one of Russia’s largest oil producers was using AI to slash the cost of oil well development and to address complicated logistics safety issues.  ,   has likely been forced to move several air defence systems from its   enclave on the   coast to the frontline in Ukraine amid the losses it has suffered there, according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). Vladimir Putin appears to have been left with no choice but to weaken the defences of   an outpost bordered by Nato members on three sides and considered one of Moscow’s most  “Exceptional Russian air transport movements through November 2023 suggest that Russia has likely moved strategic air defence systems from its Baltic coast enclave of Kaliningrad, to  ,” the MoD said in its latest intelligence update on Sunday.  ,  More than half a million people were left without power in  , Russia and   after a storm in the   area flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines, Russian state news agency Tass and Ukraine’s energy ministry said. Meanwhile, the   region experienced its heaviest snowfall in 40 years, the governor said. The storms and snowfall were part of a weather front that left one person dead and many places without electricity amid heavy snow and blizzards in   and Moldova on Sunday. The head of Russia’s national meteorological service said the storm that hit Crimea was the most powerful since record keeping began, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.  ,   Majority Leader   has announced that he’s set to bring a spending package connecting funding for   and   to the   “One of the most important tasks we must finish is taking up and passing a funding bill to ensure we as well as our friends and partners in Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific region have the necessary military capabilities to confront and deter our adversaries and competitors”. – Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker   – have argued that any Republican backing of aid to Ukraine must be tied to restricting immigration,   noted. Mr Schumer said talks regarding the border issue had gone on over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  ,  The shelves at   supermarkets are full of fruit and vegetables, cheese and meat. But many of the shoppers look at the selection with dismay  Russia’s Central Bank has raised its key lending rate four times this year to try to get inflation under control and stabilize the ruble’s exchange rate as the economy weathers the effects of Russia’s military operation in   and the Western sanctions imposed as a consequence. The last time it raised the rate — to 15%, doubled that from the beginning of the year — the bank said it was concerned about prices that were increasing at an annualized pace of about 12%. The bank now forecasts inflation for the full year, as well as next year, to be about 7.5%.  ,  Russia said on Monday there would be no meeting between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at an OSCE meeting in North Macedonia this week. Lavrov had said earlier he would join the foreign ministers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which includes Canada and the United States, in Skopje if Bulgaria opened its air space for him. He said some Western countries had requested meetings with him. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the West has sought to isolate Russia, and face-to-face meetings between senior ministers have been rare. But in response to a question at the same Primakov Readings foreign policy forum, the TASS news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying Washington had not requested a meeting “and will not request one. And there will be no meeting”. The meeting of the 57-member OSCE, which is intended to prevent conflict and security crises, takes place from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. “Apparently Bulgaria has promised Macedonia it will open its air space - if that happens then we will be there. Let’s see,” Lavrov said. “There are already several requests for meetings - including from Western representatives,” Lavrov said, without naming any countries.  ,   has reportedly pardoned two Russian men convicted of   after they deployed to the frontline in the war with  . One of the men, Denis Gorin, was recruited into a private military company after signing a contract with the Russian ministry of defence but is known to have been convicted thrice for murdering at least four people between 2003 and 2022. He was also convicted of eating the remains of his victims along with his brother,  a news outlet aligned with Radio Free Europe. He is the 17th person convicted for murder to be pardoned by the Russian president between 2022 and 2023. “At the trial, he (Gorin) admitted that they ate the murdered man who was their acquaintance,” said his neighbour Dmitry Vladimirovich.  ,   President   on Friday announced a plan to endorse a national strategy for the development of artificial intelligence, emphasizing that it’s essential to prevent a Western monopoly. Speaking at an AI conference in  , Putin noted that “it’s imperative to use Russian solutions in the field of creating reliable and transparent artificial intelligence systems that are also safe for humans.” “Monopolistic dominance of such foreign technology in Russia is unacceptable, dangerous and inadmissible,” Putin said.  ,  In audio intercepts from the front lines in  , Russian soldiers speak in shorthand of 200s to mean dead, 300s to mean wounded. The urge to flee has become common enough that they also talk of 500s —   who refuse to fight.  a growing number of Russian soldiers want out, as suggested in secret recordings obtained by The Associated Press of Russian soldiers calling home from the battlefields of the  ,   and   regions in Ukraine. The calls offer a rare glimpse of the war as it looked through Russian eyes — a point of view that seldom makes its way into Western media, largely because Russia has made it a crime to speak honestly about the conflict in Ukraine. They also show clearly how the war has progressed, from the professional soldiers who initially powered  ’s full-scale invasion to men from all walks of life compelled to serve in grueling conditions.  ,  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is turning his attention to Ukraine, NATO and the Western Balkans after weeks of intense focus on Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Now, with the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas extended for two more days, Blinken departed Monday for Brussels for a NATO foreign ministers meeting.In Brussels, the alliance will reaffirm its support for Ukraine‘s defense against Russia‘s invasion, explore ways of easing tensions between Kosovo and Serbia and look at preparations for NATO’s 75th anniversary next year. The two-day session on Tuesday and Wednesday will include the first foreign minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a body created by alliance leaders at their last summit to improve cooperation and coordination and help prepare Kyiv for eventual membership. “Allies will continue to support Ukraine‘s self-defense until Russia stops its war of aggression,” said Jim O’Brien, the top U.S. diplomat for Europe. In a call with reporters on Monday, O’Brien said Blinken may travel to Skopje, North Macedonia, after Brussels for a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  ,  Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a national budget for the next three years that increases spending by around 25% and reportedly devotes a record amount to defence as the country’s military operation in Ukraine drags on. The budget foresees spending in 2024 of 36.6 trillion roubles with an expected deficit of 1.595 trillion roubles. After the budget was passed by the lower house of the parliament, speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said it was developed specifically to fund the military and to mitigate the impact of international sanctions imposed after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Record low unemployment, higher wages and targeted social spending should help the Kremlin ride out the domestic impact of pivoting the economy towards the military, but could pose a problem in the long term, analysts say. Part of the Russian budget is secret as the Kremlin tries to conceal its military plans and sidestep scrutiny of its operation in Ukraine. But independent business journalists Farida Rustamova and Maksim Tovkaylo said this month that around 39% of all federal spending will go towards defence and law enforcement in 2024.  ,   ,  More measures may soon be taken by Finland to stop a surge in asylum seekers crossing the border from Russia. Some 900 asylum seekers from nations including Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen have entered Finland from Russia in November. Finland say the increase is an orchestrated move by Moscow in retaliation for its decision to increase defence cooperation with the United States “Intelligence information from different sources tells us that there still are people on the move ... If this continues, more measures will be announced in the near future,” Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told a press conference. Several Finnish media outlets have reported that the government had held talks over closing the whole border.  ,  We mentioned earlier about ancient artefacts from Russian-occupied Crimea being sent to Ukraine by a Dutch museum. They include precious items such as a solid gold Scythian helmet and golden neck ornament, and were on loan to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum when Russian troops seized and annexed the peninsula in 2014. Now we’re seeing video on social media of a truck carrying the items coming into Ukraine Scythian gold is already in Ukraine! A truck with 2,694 kg of cultural property entered the territory of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, where Kyiv customs officers will identify the treasures in the Treasury of the National Museum of Ukraine.  — Oleksiy Goncharenko (@GoncharenkoUa)   ,  Russian news agency TASS is reporting that four people have now died in severe cold weather in Russian-occupied Crimea. Emergency conditions have been declared in the Crimean Peninsula, Tatyana Lyubetskaya, a Russia-installed official at the region’s environmental monitoring department, told the news agency. It follows a weekend storm that pounded the Black Sea region toppled trees, tore down power lines and flooded coastal areas. More than half a million people were without power on Monday morning. The storms were part of a weather system that created blizzard-like conditions in Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria and Serbia on Sunday.  ,  Polish truckers and farmers today started a round-the-clock blockade of access to one of the busiest border crossings with Ukraine. The truckers, now blocking the Medyka crossing as well as three other border crossings, complain they are losing out to Ukrainian companies which offer cheaper prices for their services and which are transporting goods within the European Union. Tomasz Borkowski, leader of the Committee to Protect Transporters and Transport Employers, a Polish union, said: “I would like to end this protest as soon as possible, because it is as burdensome for us as for everyone around us. “We have no intention of giving up and we will stand until we get our terms.” The protest started on November 6, with truckers demanding the EU bring in a permit system for Ukrainian truckers to ensure fair competition.  ,  The factory is believed to employ around 30,000 people, and produces two of Russia’s most advanced main battle tank systems; T-72 and T-90 tanks. On Monday morning, Russia’s emergencies ministry said the fire was under control. Although it was reported that residents nearby were still without water and power.  ,  If the fire was responsibilty of Ukraine, it would be its furthest attack behind enemy lines of the war so far. Russian officials have said it was caused by a short circuit.  ,  Ancient artefacts from Russian-occupied Crimea have been sent to Ukraine by a Dutch museum. More than 1,000 Scythian artefacts, including a solid gold Scythian helmet and golden neck ornament, were on loan to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum when Russian troops seized and annexed the peninsula in 2014. Now, following a legal dispute over ownership rights between Ukraine and the Moscow-contolled territory, 565 of the items have been sent to Kyiv. They date from when the Scythian people lived in the area between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC. “This was a special case, in which cultural heritage became a victim of geopolitical developments,” said Els van der Plas, director of the Allard Pierson. “We are pleased that clarity has emerged and that they have now been returned.” It comes after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by TASS state news agency as saying the artefacts “belong to Crimea and should be there”.  ,  More than 2,000 towns and villages across Ukraine have been hit by power cuts after heavy snow  ,  After weeks of intense focus on the Israel’s war against  , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be putting Ukraine at the top of the agenda in a meeting with NATO foreign ministers this week. Mr Blinken will join the two-day sessions in Brussells tomorrow and on Wednesday, with the alliance expected to reaffirm its support for   against Russia’s invasion. “Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s self-defence until Russia stops its war of aggression,” said Jim O’Brien, the top US diplomat for Europe. The session will alos see the first foreign minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a body created by alliance leaders at their last summit to improve cooperation and coordination and help prepare Kyiv for eventual membership. The meeting will come amid continued fighting between Kyiv and Moscow - with both facing worsening weather conditions.  ,  The UN’s nuclear agency has today reported hearing several rockets appearing to have been fired closed to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. It is believed they were fired from a multiple launch rocket system nearby. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: “Today’s events once again clearly demonstrate the extremely fragile nuclear safety and security situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – located on the frontline – continues to face many potential threats as a result of this tragic war, “I remain deeply concerned about nuclear safety and security at the plant, both when it comes to its vulnerable off-site power supplies – which can be affected by attacks far away from the site – and the more direct military risks it is facing, potentially undermining the principals hat I set out at the United Nations Security Council in May. In this context, the apparent firing of rockets from near the plant is a special source of concern.”  ,  Appearing to back the data on Russian casualties reported by the UK’s Ministry of Defence today, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has said Ukraine is inflicting huge losses for the Russians in recent weeks. It comes as the fighting now takes place under a blanket of snow storms as winter sets in across the region. Mr Stoltenberg said: “We see high casualty numbers and some of the most intense fightings that we have seen throughout the whole war has actually taken place over the last weeks and couple of months. “Again we are impressed by the bravery, the competence of the Ukrainian forces, and also their ability to actually strike behind the Russian lines, deep into Russian-controlled territory. “And of course military achievements can partly be measured in square metres but also on the losses you are able to inflict on your adversary.”  ,  As Russia continues its attack on almost all sides of the eastern city of Avdiivka, we’re now hearing more on the number of injuries on the Moscow side. A briefing from Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Ukraine’s estimate on the number of daily Russian casualties has increased from 776 in March to 931 this month. It said: “Although Defence Intelligence cannot verify the methodology, taken as a total including both killed and wounded, the figures are plausible. “The last six weeks have likely seen some of the highest Russian casualty rates of the war so far. “The heavy losses have largely been caused by Russia’s offensive against the Donbas town of Avdiivka.”  ,  Mr Shapps did not hold back in his response to new figures published on the number of Russian casualties. The figures, from the Ukgrainian General Staff and described as “plausible” by the UK’s Ministry of Defence showed an average 931 Ukrainian soldiers were killed or injured every day this month. Mr Shapps wrote on X: “Putin is stepping up his invasion - senselessly sending more Russians to die than at any time since the war began. Ukrainian bravery and western support is holding back their advance, but we cannot be complacent. Ukraine needs our unwavering support to fight and win.”  ,  Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky has shared pictures showing the damage caused by the severe weather to towns and villages across Ukraine. The extreme weather comes as tens of thousands of troops man front-line positions in the 21-month-old war with Russia and amid fears Moscow could target the power grid with air strikes this winter. Ukraine’s largest private energy provider, DTEK, said early on Monday that it had been able to restore power to nearly 250 villages and towns. Bad weather has caused power outages in more than 2,000 towns and villages in 16 regions of Ukraine and has also blocked road traffic. I am grateful to all rescuers, utility workers, the National Police, local authorities, and engineers working around the clock to help people.  — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)   ,  Meta spokesperson Andy Stone has been added to Russia’s wanted list on unspecified terrorism charges, according to media reports. It comes after Russia banned Facebook and Instragram in March 2022, calling parent company Meta “extremist”. Media reports say Mr Stone is wanted by Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, reported Mediazona, an independent news website that covers Russia’s opposition and prison system.  ,  “I would like to thank everyone who is working now and will continue to work tomorrow to protect us from this bad weather,” said Volodymyr Zelensky, as he praised his soldiers amid brutal winter weather conditions in the conflict with Russia. Snowstorms and high winds had left 400 settlements without power, he said. He added: “Now, when it is so difficult, in such conditions, we should all be especially grateful to those who defend our country, who carry out Ukrainian offensive operations, who are in combat positions, at combat posts, on duty in mobile fire groups and in all our other units that protect Ukraine, the life of our state and our independence.”  ,  Ukraine was hit by a severe snowstorm today, with more than 2,000 villages and towns witout power and dozens of motorways closed. The extreme weather comes as tens of thousands of troops man front-line positions in the 21-month-old war with Russia and amid fears Moscow could target the power grid with air strikes this winter. At least 1,370 cargo trucks were stuck and 840 cars had to be towed away amid snow drifts that in some places were two meters (6.56 ft) high, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on the Telegram messenger. Southern and central Ukraine were the worst hit, he said. Volodymyr Zelensky said: “I would like to thank everyone who is working now and will continue to work tomorrow to protect us from this bad weather and to restore normal living conditions in all our Ukrainian communities as soon as possible.”  ,  Almost half a million people have been left without power and one person was killed after a storm in the Black Sea area flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines in Crimea, Russian state news agency Tass said. The storm also hit southern Russia and sent waves flooding into the beach resort of Sochi, blew the roof off a five-story building off in Anapa and damaged homes and schools in Kuban, the state news agency said. It was part of a weather front that earlier left one person dead and hundreds of places without electricity amid heavy snowfall and strong blizzards in Romania and Moldova on Sunday. The storm prompted several Crimean regions to declare a state of emergency after it became the strongest recorded in the past 16 years with wind speeds reaching 144 kph (almost 90 mph), Tatyana Lyubetskaya, a Russia-installed official at the Crimean environmental monitoring department, told Tass. The government in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, told people to stay at home on Monday and closed government offices including schools and hospitals as strong winds are still expected Monday.  ,  Russia is having to move several air defence systems from the Baltic Sea coast to the frontline after losses to its SA-21 air defence systems in occupied Ukraine, according to UK Ministry of Defence. Ukrainian attacks most likely destroyed at least four Russian surface-to-air missile systems that were located in occupied territories in a span of a single week, the MoD said in an earlier update on 2 November. It now appears that Putin has been forced to move the systems from Kaliningrad, which is considered one of Moscow’s mosts strategically sensitive regions.  ,  Russian armoured vehicles attacked Ukrainian positions on the south eastern part of the key city of Avdiivka on Sunday, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank. The group also says Putin’s forces have also made advances in the town of Krasnohorivka, around four miles north of Avdiivka. The attacks illustrate the focus of Russian forces on capturing the city, which is 13 miles north of Donetsk and was an industrial centre before the war.  ,  The shelves at   supermarkets are full of fruit and vegetables, cheese and meat.

{"title": "Vermont police investigate shooting of 3 Palestinian college students as possible hate crime: What we know", "author": "Dylan Stableford", "timestamp": null, "content": "Law enforcement officials in Burlington, Vt., are investigating the shooting of three 20-year-old Palestinian college students on Saturday as a possible hate crime. Jason Eaton, a 48-year-old resident of Burlington, was arrested Sunday afternoon by federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, authorities said. Eaton was arraigned on Monday and charged with three counts of attempted murder in the second degree. He pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail. According to the Burlington Police Department, the students were walking along a street at around 6:30 p.m. on Saturday when they were confronted by a man with a handgun who fired at least four rounds “without speaking” and then fled on foot. The victims — identified as Hisham Awartani, a student at Brown University in Rhode Island; Kinnan Abdalhamid, a student at Haverford College in Pennsylvania; and Tahseen Ahmad, a student at Trinity College in Connecticut — were in Burlington to visit Awartani’s grandmother for the Thanksgiving holiday. Two were shot in the torso, one in the lower extremities, police said, and transported to the University of Vermont Medical Center. Two of the students were listed in stable condition Sunday. One was listed in serious condition. According to police, at least two of the students were wearing traditional Palestinian scarves, called keffiyehs, when they were shot. Local police, FBI and ATF agents conducted a canvass of the neighborhood Sunday and arrested Eaton, who lives in an apartment across the street from the scene. Evidence collected during a search of the apartment “gave investigators and prosecutors probable cause to believe that Mr. Eaton perpetrated the shooting,”  . “I hope that Burlington’s Palestinian, Arab and Muslim communities see in today’s prompt arrest the city’s commitment to justice in keeping all members of our community safe,” Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said at a news briefing. Pro-Palestinian and antiwar activists have held numerous rallies in Burlington against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. Police have yet to officially identify a motive for the shooting. But the incident comes amid a  y since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October. The U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Vermont said it is investigating whether the shooting may have been a hate crime. Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said that police are still working to identify the motive but had enough evidence to charge Eaton in the shooting. “In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime,” Murad said in a press release prior to Eaton’s arrest. An attorney for the victims’ families, Abed Ayoub,   that he believes the students were targeted because two of them were wearing keffiyehs. “The suspect walked up to them and shot them. They weren’t robbed, they weren’t mugged,” Ayoub said Sunday. “It was a targeted shooting and a targeted crime.” At a briefing Monday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that President Biden and first lady Jill Biden were “horrified” to learn about the attack. “These students were taking part in a uniquely American tradition gathering with family and loved ones to celebrate Thanksgiving,” she said. “They should be back in school with their classmates, not in a hospital room. The president, first lady and everyone here at the White House join Americans across the country in praying for their full recovery. And we send our deepest condolences to their families and the broader Palestinian Arab and Muslim American communities. “There is absolutely, absolutely no place for violence or hate in America,” she added. “No person should worry about being targeted while going about their daily lives. And far too many Americans know a family member injured or killed as a result of gun violence. We cannot and we will not accept that.”       The White House released a statement on the president's behalf later Monday:"},

That’s how Cairo Eubanks felt when photos she’d shared on Facebook had been posted on a lewd Instagram account by someone she knew in college. “I was shocked,” Eubanks said. “He posted those pictures and was using my name as well as saying some very dirty things that I did not feel comfortable with him posting. I’ve seen him before and he sent me messages that were a little creepy.” The 28-year-old blocked and reported him. He then reached out to her again after creating new social media accounts. Out of frustration, she wrote about her experience on Facebook. To her surprise, 30 others responded that the same person had been harassing them online for years. “I felt violated when it happened to me and angry that it was happening to so many people,” she said. Eubanks, who said her first name Cairo means “victorious one,” created a Facebook group with the people who’d been harassed. She asked them to tell their stories and share evidence. People from the group then used the evidence to file police reports and reached out to their college. “School administration actually changed some of their policies as a result of what we said and how we spoke up,” Eubanks said. She didn’t stop there. In 2020, Eubanks created Operation Stop Cyber Harassment, a free online conference to teach teens and parents how to report online harassment. “We are empowering parents and teens to see themselves as digital citizens capable of protecting themselves online, reporting cyberbullying and online threats and advocating for others,” Eubanks said. Eubanks is beginning a monthly Digital Citizen Training Bootcamp. The free, online four-week program will provide cyberbullying prevention strategies, mental health support, online safety tools and digital responsibility. “She has the qualities that you are looking for in a leader,” said Lynne Warrick, a 100-year-old community advocate, especially for minorities, who is a mentor of Eubanks and founder of Lynne Warrick Institute, which offers tutoring to South Florida students. “She is motivated, and she follows through. You give her something to do and it’s as good as done.” Eubanks, who was Miss Black Florida 2022, said winning the pageant gave her a platform and helped her to inspire Black girls. “A little girl with dreads came up to me and said she didn’t know it was possible for her to become a pageant queen,” Eubanks said. “I’m grateful that I grew up in a Jamaican household where locks were appreciated and celebrated,” Eubanks added. “But that wasn’t always the case. When I was in school, I dealt with microaggressions from people who didn’t understand my hair. So anywhere I go, especially when I see little Black girls or little girls of underrepresented minorities, I want to make sure that they know how powerful, smart and beautiful they are.” Eubanks has always had an interest in the world around her. In college, she majored in international studies with a concentration in African studies. She later taught in India. So, it was a natural fit for her to become the youth representative of the New Future Foundation of the United Nations Department of Global Communications (UN DGC) and a U.N. committee co-chair. She was the recipient of the 2022 Young Pacesetter for Africa Development Award on Africa Day at the United Nations. “In her role as co-chair, Cairo serves as a shining example of youth advocacy,” said Hawa Diallo, chief of the Civil Society Unit, U.N. Department of Global Communications.“Cairo’s unwavering commitment to forging connections between the communities of South Florida and those around the globe is a testament to her dedication and vision for a better world.” To learn more about the free, monthly Digital Citizen Training Bootcamp, visit  .

The airline has obtained special approval from British, Irish, Canadian and US aviation authorities to fly the pioneering mission. The founder of Virgin Atlantic,  , and the transport secretary,  , will be aboard the aircraft – though it will not carry any paying passengers. Saf is made from sustainable sources such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil, meaning its production involves using about 70% less carbon. The two Rolls-Royce engines will be mainly fuelled by processed waste fats, known as HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids). But 12 per cent of plant-based “synthetic aromatic kerosene” (SAK) is added to provide the necessary mix for the engines to function normally. Virgin Atlantic claims the fuel offers “CO2 lifecycle emissions savings of up to 70 per cent, whilst performing like the traditional jet fuel it replaces”. The emissions from the 3,451-mile flight will be exactly the same as with a kerosene-powered flight. Savings are claimed from elsewhere in the lifecycle – for example CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere during the growth of plants, and from avoiding household waste going to landfill. Environmental campaigners dispute the benefits, and say only a cutback in flying can significantly reduce the harm caused by aviation. But speaking exclusively to  , Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, Shai Weiss, said: “To think that we can magic up elimination of flying, I think is naive to an extreme.” His airline says the aim is to demonstrate that SAF is a “safe drop-in replacement for fossil derived jet fuel, compatible with today’s engines, airframes and fuel infrastructure”. Sir Richard said: “The world will always assume something can’t be done, until you do it. The spirit of innovation is getting out there and trying to prove that we can do things better for everyone’s benefit. “Virgin Atlantic has been challenging the status quo and pushing the aviation industry to never settle and do better since 1984. Fast forward nearly 40 years, that pioneering spirit continues to be Virgin Atlantic’s beating heart as it pushes the boundaries from carbon fibre aircraft and fleet upgrades to sustainable fuels. “I couldn’t be prouder to be onboard Flight100 today alongside the teams at Virgin Atlantic and our partners, which have been working together to set the flight path for the decarbonisation of long-haul aviation.” Mr Harper said: “Today’s 100 per cent SAF-powered flight shows how we can decarbonise transport both now and in the future, cutting lifecycle emissions by 70 per cent and inspiring the next generation of solutions. “This government has backed today’s flight to take-off and we will continue to support the UK’s emerging SAF industry as it create jobs, grows the economy and gets us to Jet Zero.” But environmental campaigners say the potential benefits of SAF are overstated – and that there are multiple problems with the supply of the fuel. Anna Hughes, director of Flight Free UK, said: “While it sounds promising that a flight can be fuelled with 100 per cent SAF, we are many years away from seeing so-called ‘sustainable’ fuels in widespread use. “We simply don’t have enough resources to create enough SAF to satisfy our current, or indeed future, demand for flights. We don’t have time to wait, so the reality is that in order to reliably bring down flight emissions, we need to be flying less, which is certainly not what the industry wants to hear. “This is a seminal moment for the industry and government, allowing them to pretend that we can continue to fly as much as we like with no harm to the environment. The reality is that we still haven’t worked out how to meaningfully reduce the environmental harms of flying, so the short-term answer must be that we need to do it a lot less.” , when an RAF Voyager aircraft – the military version of an Airbus A330 – made a test flight from Brize Norton in Oxfordshire."},

He is suspected of ambushing three 20-year-old college students – Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ahmad – as they walked to a family Thanksgiving dinner on Saturday night. The friends were speaking to each other in English and Arabic, police said, and two of them were wearing keffiyehs at the time. Mr Eaton appeared in court on Monday for arraignment, where he pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder. Burlington Police offered an update on the case at a press conference shortly after the arraignment. They revealed that Mr Eaton apparently did not leave his home following the shooting nearby. When police knocked on his door on Sunday, he allegedly said: “I’ve been waiting for you.” Suspect pleads not guilty during arraignment Mother of suspected shooter said he has history of mental illness Jason Eaton could face life imprisonment if convicted Mother of student says ‘it’s unlikely he’ll be able to use his legs again' Families of students release joint statement calling for hate crime charges  ,  Wendy Raymond, the president of Haverford College, released a   regarding the shooting on Monday, announcing that the university would be taking measures to support students and staff following the incident, including implementing Islamic grief counseling, a candlelight vigil and additional psychological services. Kinnan Abdalhamid, a junior at the university, was wounded in the shooting. “This attack has the power to terrify because it shows how vulnerable we are, in so many ways,” Ms Raymond said. “Together, we will walk in and through it”. In October, while speaking to the  , the university’s student newspaper, Mr Abdalhamid, criticised the president’s response to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, stating that she did not mention the Palestinians killed by Israel in her early comments immediately after the fighting began that month. “She did not mourn the Palestinian citizens who were killed, or the children who were killed by this ruthless bombing,” Mr Abdalhamid said. The newspaper said the student had lived under Israeli military occupation from when he was three until he began studying at the university. “I don’t expect much from Western media or the college to mention much about Israel’s oppression and apartheid,” said Mr Abdalhamid, “But I at least expect the thousands who were killed to be mentioned and mourned.”  ,  Elizabeth Price, the mother of Hisham Awartani, 20, told   that doctors believe it’s unlikely that her son may be able to walk following the shooting. “He’s confronting a life of disability, a potentially irreversible change to his life and what it means for his future,” she told the outlet. Her son is currently attending Brown University, where he is studying mathematics and archaeology. He recently graduated from a Quaker-run K-12 school in the West Bank called Ramallah Friends School. Ms Price, who lives in the West Bank with her husband, Marwan Awartani, said the couple is struggling to get out of the territory and into the US. They plan to cross by land into Jordan before taking a flight to the US, the outlet reported. The students have been friends ever since childhood, she said. “These are boys who grew up in my house, I consider all three of them my children,” Price says. “I am so glad I’m going to see them and care for them.” The students were staying with the woman’s brother, Rich Price, at his home in Vermont for Thanksgiving. The mother told the outlet that her and her husband decided to keep her son in Burlington over the holidays rather than have him travel back to the West Bank given the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. “My husband didn’t want Hisham to come back for Christmas,” she told the outlet. “He thought our son would be safer [in the U.S.] than in Palestine.” Now, she said, “My husband is so bitter”.  ,  According to  , Mary Reed, the mother of Jason Eaton, the suspect in the shooting, said her son had previously struggled with depression and other mental health issues. The family celebrated Thanksgiving just days prior to the incident, she said. “It was the best Thanksgiving we had in years,” the woman told the outlet. “We were all together.” Ms Reed described her son as a “kind and loving person”. Still, “Jason has had a lot of struggles in his life,” she said. “I am just shocked by the whole thing.” She said her son had not mentioned the war between Israel and Hamas during their recent interaction. She said he was “totally normal” during the meal and “in such a good mood”. Ms Reed only learned of the shooting Monday morning, when her daughter came over to wake her up, she told the outlet. “I just don’t understand,” she said. “I can’t believe he would do something like this.”  ,  During a briefing on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has been informed about the incident and is wishing the men a “full recovery”. “The President and the First Lady were horrified to learn about the three college students of Palestinian descent, two of whom are American citizens who were shot Saturday in Burlington, Vermont,” Ms Jean-Pierre said. “The President continues to receive updates from his team about the ongoing investigation.

{"title": "Young Thug trial - update: Judge rips lawyers in YSL Rico case", "author": null, "timestamp": null, "content": "The hotly-anticipated trial of the rapper   is underway in a courtroom in Atlanta, Georgia, following almost a year of delays. Back in May 2022, Young Thug, real name Jeffery Williams, was arrested and charged in a Fulton County District Attorney   – who is using the same law to prosecute   over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state – accused the suspects of being part of a criminal street   named YSL. According to prosecutors, the gang is responsible for a series of violent crimes, including murders, shootings, carjackings and  . Young Thug has denied the accusations and insisted that YSL is simply Young Thug’s record label – Young Slime Life. After several defendants took plea deals or had their cases severed, the Grammy Award-winning rapper and five others are finally going on trial. The trial is off to a rocky start. A late juror delayed the trial by an hour and a half. The prosecution faced three objections from the defence, all of which were sustained, and the defence motioned for a mistrial, but the bid was denied. Opening statements to begin today Young Thug charged in sprawling RICO case What is YSL?  ,  The case hinges on Donovan Thomas, whom the indictment describes as “an associate of a rival gang.” He was killed in a drive-by shooting on 10 January 2015. Fulton County DA Fani Willis described Thomas’s killing led to a gang war that “created violence like Atlanta has never seen.” The prosecutor accused Jeffery Williams aka Young Thug of renting a car, despite owning a car, that other YSL members used to “notoriously gun down Donovan Thomas.” The defence argued that there are “no eyewitnesses” of Thomas’ killing and insinuated that Spencer Wright aka “fabricated” seeing the killing, as he pointed out that Mr Wright initially used a false name — Nicholas Robinson — when talking to investigators. Then, using Mr Wright’s word, detectives got warrants for his client, Shannon Stillwell, among others, he said.  ,  “There were no eyewitnesses” of the murder of Donovan Thomas, Max Schardt of the defence team told the jury. “No one had been charged for nine months and nine days.” The indictment describes Thomas as an “associate of a rival gang.” He said there is surveillance footage of the incident, which jurors will be able to watch. The Fulton County District Attorney has said that Thomas’s killing led to a gang war that “created violence like Atlanta has never seen,” therefore much of the case connects back to this drive-by death.  ,  Defence attorney Max Schardt started by saying his client, Shannon Stillwell, “is an innocent man.” Mr Schardt said that Shannon “trying to make it in rap, sold marijuana” and pleaded guilty. He tried to separate Mr Stillwell’s past as being totally separate from YSL. He said he had done his time for the drug charges. “We’re not hiding that Shannon Stillwell sold drugs...or was found in possession of a firearm. These are his pasts and his truths,” he added. “But the evidence will show that Shannon’s decisions had nothing to do with YSL or any other organisation.”  ,  Today was a rocky start to the hotly anticipated trial of rapper Young Thug, aka Jeffery Williams, and 28 other defendants who are allegedly involved in the criminal gang YSL; the defence argues that YSL is merely a record label. The trial was immediately delayed by an hour and a half, as the court was waiting for one late juror. Then, the prosecution started its opening statements, which were met with numerous objections, and some disagreement over whether the prosecution provided the defence with slides it was showing the jurors. The jury then had to leave, came back briefly, before being let off for a lunch recess. After the court returned from lunch, the judge snapped at attorneys from both sides for having “wasted two hours.” Hours after she began, prosecutor Adriane Love resumed her opening statement, which focused on depicting how YSL operates and portraying Mr Williams as the ringleader. She also already incorporated some of the defendants’ lyrics — the inclusion of which was itself a heated topic ahead of the trial.  ,  Ms Love emphasised that law enforcement were “happening upon the lyrics while trying to solve a murder.” She read some of defendant Shannon Stillwell’s lyrics, which included a reference to murder after he was released on bond for the murder of Donovan Thomas, she said.  ,  YSL uses a certain set of symbols and other idiosyncrasies to identify themselves, according to Prosecutor Love. These included: substituting the letter “C” with the letter “B,” like “Bleveland” vs Cleveland or “Bhris” vs Chris using certain emojis: Green Heart, Green Snake, Blowing Nose, and Green Vomit emojis using certain hand signs  ,  “The only time...that members of YSL don’t want to call themselves and acknowledge hat they are in fact a gang is when it would be to their detriment. The evidence will show that they are loudly and proudly promoting their criminal activities,” Ms Love said during her opening statement.  ,  “We didn't chase any of the lyrics to solve any murders. Law enforcement in Fulton County chased the murders and found the lyrics,” Ms Love said. The prosecutor then started quoting a Young Thug song. The use of lyrics from rappers associated with YSL and Young Thug in the case has been an ongoing point of contention. Earlier this month, the judge ruled that he would allow prosecutors to introduce 17 sets of lyrics — so long as they can demonstrate that those lyrics are related to crimes that the rapper and other defendants are accused of committing. The defence team had argued against the lyrics’ inclusion in the case, arguing they are constitutionally protected speech. “The lyrics [defendants] chose to speak...bore a very eerie significance to real life,” Ms Love added.  ,  Young Thug aka Jeffery Williams is being painted as the head of YSL by the state. “The defendant Jeffery Williams’ words and actions betrayed his participation in the conspiracy,” Ms Love said. He rented a car, despite owning a car, that other YSL members used to “notoriously gun down Donovan Thomas,” the prosecutor added.  ,  The prosecutor is painting Jeffery Williams aka Young Thug as the “leader” of YSL. She said that a machine gun was found at the rapper’s home. Ms Love said there will be no evidence to show “any need for that.” She repeated that YSL’s goal is to “maintain dominance and control” of the area.  ,  Prosecutor Love said defendant Rodalius Ryan’s youth and life were “swallowed up in the crater created by YSL.” Twelve hours after killing Jamari Holmes, Mr Ryan posted on his Instagram predicting that YSL ‘makes the news,’ she said, adding that he was “promoting the gang.”  ,  Many hours later, due to a series of objections and a recess for lunch break, the prosecution resumed its opening statement. A conspiracy requires “just one overt act, so you will see evidence of several overt acts...that were done by these defendants” and other unnamed people “to further the goal of the conspriacy,” Ms Love said. She said these “steps” taken that had nothing to do” with a record label.”  ,  Young Thug’s racketeering conspiracy charge and two gang charges each carry a penalty of five to 20 years in prison. The other five charges also carry potential prison time.  ,  The judge asked one defence lawyer to have his client ‘put on his shoes.’ It’s unclear which defendant the judge was referring to when he made the strange request. The jury was supposed to return at 1.45pm after a lunch break but it has been more than 45 minutes and the jurors have yet to reenter the courtroom. In the meantime, the judge has snapped at the attorneys for having “wasted” nearly two hours as both sides have yet to complete their opening statements.  ,  “We have wasted almost two hours trying to get this stuff done,” the judge said. He then banned either side from using Powerpoints after a debacle after the state allegedly didn’t provide updates it made to its slideshow, shown to jurors in opening arguments, to the defence. Both sides argued for the judge to change his mind. The jurors have yet to return to the courtroom as the conversation between attorneys and the judge continues.  ,  “If you don’t listen to the court, you’re going to get into hot water,” he said, clearly frustrated with both sides.  ,  The defence team has yet to give opening statements today. But in numerous court filings, the rapper’s attorneys have said that he is innocent of all crimes charged in the indictment. They argue YSL is simply a record label. Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams, has pleaded not guilty.  ,  Opening arguments were supposed to restart after lunch at 1.45pm. This trial is only on its first day and has already been plagued by a series of objections and delays, including a juror showing up over an hour late.  ,  The indictment portrays Young Thug as the leader of the criminal gang, which was responsible for multiple violent crimes, including murders, shootings and carjackings. Prosecutors say the rapper also used his music and social media posts to promote the gang, He is also alleged to have committed multiple crimes that he has not been charged with. While he is not being charged for such “overt acts”, they lend credence to the allegation that the group of defendants were together engaged in a criminal conspiracy. Brian Steel, Young Thug’s lawyer, told  : “Mr Williams came from an incredibly horrible upbringing, and he has conducted himself throughout his life in a way that is just to marvel at. He’s committed no crime whatsoever.”  ,  The use of lyrics from rappers associated with YSL and Young Thug in the case has been an ongoing point of contention. Earlier this month, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville ruled that he would allow prosecutors to introduce 17 sets of lyrics, as long as they can show that the lyrics are related to crimes that the rapper and other defendants are accused of committing. Defence attorneys had asked the judge to exclude them, arguing the lyrics are constitutionally protected speech and would be unfairly prejudicial.  ,  After a series of delays and objections, the judge sent the jury to lunch until 1.45pm. The latest delay occurred after the defence team took issue with one of the slides that the prosecutors showed the jury, saying they hadn’t seen the slide ahead of the trial, which violated the judge’s order last week. The judge then required the prosecution to send over all of the slides it planned to use while the defence reviewed it, causing another delay.  ,  Young Thug has been in prison since his arrest in May 2022. Earlier this month, a jury was finally selected after almost one year – with over 2,000 people having been summoned to possibly serve. Now, opening statements in the trial are set to begin on 27 November.  reports that the trial could end up being the longest in Georgia’s history.  ,  The YSL Rico trial has been anything but dull — even on its first day of opening arguments. A late juror delayed the trial by an hour and a half. Then, during its opening statement, the prosecution faced three objections from the defence, all of which were sustained. The defence motioned for a mistrial, because it hadn’t seen all of the slides that the prosecution was showing the jury, but the bid was denied. The judge scolded both sides for the turbulent trial start: “I’m not happy about any of this.”  ,  The judge said he denied the motion. Mr Steel then argued that he didn’t receive the displays used by the prosecution ahead of the trial. Ms Love said it was an “inadvertent omission.” The judge then got testy. He said “I'm not happy about any of this,” as the jury was delayed again and the defence’s sidebar earlier. The judge instructed prosecutors to hand over any additional slides that she hasn’t provided the defence team in the next five minutes. The defence team now has a few minutes to review the unseen slides.  ,  Mr Williams’ defence attorney Brian Steel is moving for a mistrial because prosecutor Adriane Love’s team presented a slide on the screen, shown to jurors, that indicated that Mr Steel represented Rodalius Ryan in another case.  ,  The prosecution said that it took the judge four hours to read the 65-count indictment last year. Young Thug is charged with eight of those 65 counts.  ,  Adriane Love, the state prosecutor, explained the history of YSL and how it operates, emphasising the rapper’s leadership role. YSL came from ROC [Raised on Cleaveland] Crew. Ms Love said that Mr Williams, aka Young Thug, became one of its leaders. “There will be no evidence of a written contract...because this was a group of people...who used common colors and symbols to communicate to one another and identify to the rest of the world,” Ms Love explained. The associates of YSL moved like a pack, “with the defendant Jeffery Williams as its head.” The evidence will show that “YSL checks all the boxes of being a criminal street gang,” she said.  ,  Prosecutor Adriane Love opened up with quote from  “YSL operated as a pack,” she said. For 10 years and counting, the group calling itself Young Slime Life dominated the Cleaveland Avenue community of Fulton County. They created a crater...that sucked the youth, the innocence, and even the lives of some of its members.”  ,  Born in 1991 as Jeffrey Lamar Williams, Young Thug is an Atlanta-born rapper. He also goes by the name Slime. After starting his career at the age of 19, he signed with Gucci Mane’s record label, and went on to become one of the most influential artists on the contemporary hip-hop and trap music scene. His first two albums “So Much Fun”, in 2019, and “Punk”, in 2021, debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, as did his 2021 joint compilation album with Gunna, “Slime Language 2”. Young Thug has also featured in multiple collaborations that have earned him several number one hits. These include guest spots on Camila Cabello’s   in 2018, Travis Scott and MIA’s   in 2020 and Drake and Future’s   in 2021, all of which topped the Billboard Hot 100. He also co-wrote the hit song   with Childish Gambino, real name Donald Glover, which became the first hip-hop track to win Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards in 2019.  ,  More than 6,500 people have tuned in to watch the live RICO trial of Young Thug. Opening arguments are now beginning after an hour and a half delay due to a juror having car problems.  ,  Judge Ural Glanville is reading the charges brought against each of the 28 defendants. All of the defendants have pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, the judge said.  ,  The indictment portrays Young Thug as the leader of the criminal gang, which was responsible for multiple violent crimes, including murders, shootings and carjackings. Prosecutors say the rapper also used his music and social media posts to promote the gang, He is also alleged to have committed multiple crimes that he has not been charged with. While he is not being charged for such “overt acts”, they lend credence to the allegation that the group of defendants were together engaged in a criminal conspiracy. Brian Steel, Young Thug’s lawyer, told  : “Mr Williams came from an incredibly horrible upbringing, and he has conducted himself throughout his life in a way that is just to marvel at. He’s committed no crime whatsoever.”  ,  After the opening arguments were delayed, due to one juror’s absence, all jurors are now present, the judge said. The trial is now set to begin.  ,  Nearly 10 months after jury selection began, a panel of Georgia citizens was selected Wednesday for the trial of rapper Young Thug and several other people accused of participating in a criminal street gang responsible for violent crimes. The Atlanta-based artist, whose given name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, and six others are now set to stand trial beginning Nov. 27 after prosecutors and defense attorneys chose 12 jurors and six alternates, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The trial is expected to last months. The sprawling indictment returned in May included more than two dozen defendants. But eight — including rapper Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens — took plea deals and 12 others will be tried separately, the newspaper reported. ...  ,  “YSL is a criminal street gang that started in late 2012 in the Cleveland Avenue area of Atlanta, Georgia. YSL claims affiliation with the national Bloods gang. YSL’s founders were Jeffery Williams AKA ‘Young Thug,’ AKA ‘Slime,’ Walter Murphy AKA “DK,” and Trontavious Stephens AKA ‘Tick,’ AKA ‘Slug.’ Jeffery Williams, an Atlanta-based hip-hop artist, made YSL a well-known name by referring to it in his songs and on social media.”  ,  Judge Ural Glanville said that the opening arguments are delayed as one juror has not shown up — after it took 11 months to pick the jury. They are trying to “locate” her, he said.  ,  Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis — the same prosecutor working on the former president’s Georgia case — accused Yung Thug aka Jeffrey Williams, of being in a “position of leadership” in Young Slime Life, which she claims is a criminal street gang in a 56-count indictment. The rapper has denied the claims; he and 27 others were charged with conspiracy to violate Georgia’s RICO Act. Young Thug has been incarcerated since 9 May 2022. According to   he has filed for bond four times but has been denied three times because the judge thinks the rapper poses a danger to the community.  ,  The use of lyrics from rappers associated with YSL and Young Thug in the case has been an ongoing point of contention. Earlier this month, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville ruled that he would allow prosecutors to introduce 17 sets of lyrics, as long as they can show that the lyrics are related to crimes that the rapper and other defendants are accused of committing. Defence attorneys had asked the judge to exclude them, arguing the lyrics are constitutionally protected speech and would be unfairly prejudicial. “The question is not rap lyrics. The question is gang lyrics,” prosecutor Mike Carlson said, during a pre-trial hearing. “These are party admissions. They happen to come in the form of lyrics.” Mr Carlson had argued that First Amendment speech protections do not apply because the defendants are not being prosecuted for their lyrics. Instead, he said, the lyrics refer to the criminal act or the criminal intent related to the charges. Another prosecutor, Simone Hylton, also separated the lyrics into three categories: those that prove the existence of YSL as an enterprise, those that show the gang’s behaviour and actions, and those that show that Young Thug is a leader of the gang.  ,  YSL — Young Slime Life is a record label and alleged criminal street gang. The YSL members named in the indictment are charged with conspiracy to violate Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The act is similar to its federal counterpart, which is used to convict large-scale organisations such as the mafia. According to the indictment, associates of YSL “conspired to associate together and with others for the common purposes of illegally obtaining money and property through a pattern of racketeering activity”. It claims that YSL members were involved in murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, theft, drug dealing, carjacking, and witness intimidation. Other activities include “the posting of messages, images, videos and songs, demonstrating allegiance to the enterprise and willingness to engage in violence on its behalf”. Prosecutors claim they can show that some of the group’s lyrics are related to crimes that they are accused of committing.  ,  Young Thug has been in prison since his arrest in May 2022. Earlier this month, a jury was finally selected after almost one year – with over 2,000 people having been summoned to possibly serve. There has been numerous other challenges in the courtroom – from getting the defendants housed in different jails to court each day to dealing with contraband in the courtroom and, wildly, the arrests of a defence attorney and a courtroom deputy. Now, opening statements in the trial are set to begin today. It could be the longest trial in Georgia’s history.  ,  The indictment portrays Young Thug as the leader of the criminal gang, which was responsible for multiple violent crimes, including murders, shootings and carjackings.

Through these activities and more the gang aimed to “preserve, protect, and enhance the reputation, power and territory” of the enterprise, prosecutors said.  ,  It depends who you ask. YSL is Young Thug’s own record label – Young Slime Life. Artists on his record label are considered part of the “Slime Family,” and a compilation album, “Slime Language 2,” rose to number one on the US charts in April 2021. Its artists include Gunna and Lil Keed, though several contemporary artists, including Future, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, Lil Baby, and Travis Scott have also expressed allegiance to YSL without being contractually signed. However, according to prosecutors, YSL is actually a “criminal street gang”, which started out in the Cleveland Avenue area of Atlanta and claims affiliation to the national Bloods gang. According to a sprawling 88-page indictment, the members of YSL use “a variety of identifiers including colours, clothing, tattoos, and hand signs” to show their allegiance to the group. The most predominant colours used by members of YSL are red for Bloods and green for Slime. Defence attorneys meanwhile insist that YSL is just a music label.  ,  Born in 1991 as Jeffrey Lamar Williams, Young Thug is an Atlanta-born rapper. He also goes by the name Slime.

Since Nov. 10, tens of thousands of earthquakes and tremors have hit the Reykjanes Peninsula causing roads to split in half and houses to buckle. Iceland continues to wait for the looming eruption from the Fagradalsfjall volcano. In the early hours of Monday morning, the Icelandic Meteorological Office detected the strongest earthquake to hit the affected area in the last 48 hours.   that were recorded between 7 p.m. ET and 6 a.m. ET, the most powerful had a magnitude of 3.0. At least   occurred 3-5 kilometers below the surface. Since 6 a.m. ET, there have been an additional 200 earthquakes bringing the daily rate to 500 earthquakes per day. Last Friday, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management downgraded the public safety level from an emergency level to a dangerous level. The “Alert Phase” that is now implemented means that there is a heightened risk in the area and that restrictions, closures and evacuation procedures are likely to be put in place. Assessments from the Meteorological Office stated that the possibility of a sudden eruption near Grindavik has been decreasing every day and is now considered small. Although the town of Grindavik remains relatively safe, an eruption is still possible above the magma tunnel that lies between  .     The more than 3,600 residents of Grindavik have been allowed to return to their homes for a number of hours to check on livestock and to collect personal belongings. However, until scientists can state that there is no danger, the locals will be unable to return home for good. Due to the damage to the major infrastructure including the sewage system, it is most likely to be months before Grindavik residents can return home. Those who have been forced into temporary accommodation have been given financial support by the government to cover rent. Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir said that Parliament is set to discuss housing support for the evacuees this week and a bill on financial assistance is expected to be passed. “The last time that an evacuation of an entire sizable settlement took place was 50 years ago, in 1973, when a volcano unexpectedly erupted on the island of Heimaey off the south coast of Iceland,” Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University in England, told Yahoo News. Three major roads that connect Grindavik to other areas have been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure. No flights have been affected as of Monday. However, Grindavik is located roughly 40 miles from Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, and less than 20 miles from Keflavik International Airport. A popular tourist attraction, the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa, will  . “The last time eruptions like this occurred in this area was circa 800 years ago, when the area was sparsely populated,” McGarvie said. The Reykjanes Peninsula has experienced a relatively small eruption every year for the last three years, and all three occurred far from residential areas. The last volcano in Iceland to cause trouble internationally was Eyjafjallajökull, which erupted in 2010. A huge ash cloud that blew five miles into the sky grounded flights across Europe, forcing a shutdown of its airspace."},
{"title": "Man sentenced in $7M scam targeting local Orthodox Jewish community", "author": null, "timestamp": null, "content": "A 58-year-old Sherman Oaks man was sentenced to nearly seven and a half years in federal prison Monday for scamming fellow members of a San Fernando Orthodox Jewish Israeli community out of more than $7 million through an investment company he and his brother operated out of their parents’ home, authorities announced.  Sassi Mizrahi was found guilty on five counts of wire fraud and, along with the 87 months of prison time, was ordered to pay some $4.47 million in restitution.  His brother, 51-year-old Encino resident Motty Mizrahi, pleaded guilty in January of this year to six counts of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.  From June 2012 to March 2019, the Mizrahi brothers fraudulently raised millions of dollars from at least 40 investors in their community, promising them “guaranteed” returns of 2% and 3% a month and annual rates between 30% and 102%, according to a   from the United States Department of Justice, Central District of California.  The brothers also assured their victims that their money could be withdrawn on an on-demand basis after an initial holding period.  Portraying himself falsely as a licensed broker, a certified public accountant and an experienced trader, Motty told victims that he and his brother’s business, MBIG Company, used “sophisticated financial option-and-insurance-hedging strategies” to get returns on their clients’ investments.  However, neither brother ever invested their victims’ money in accounts under MBIG’s name. Motty transferred most of the victims’ funds into personal trading accounts at E*TRADE and TD Ameritrade where he sustained losses of more than $3 million.  Prosecutors said Sassi also received hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor money and then helped his brother keep the truth from community members that invested with MBIG.  “For years…Sassi Mizrahi and his brother, co-defendant Motty Mizrahi… operated a Ponzi scheme that targeted victims they knew had reason to trust them: fellow members of the close-knit, Orthodox Jewish Israeli community of the San Fernando Valley,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. “Exploiting the goodwill engendered by such affinity, defendants scammed millions of dollars from their victims with false promises of risk-free investments and guaranteed returns.” The Mizrahi brothers also filed fake monthly account statements meant to trick victims into believing MBIG had consistent monthly financial gains and had balances between $6 million and $9 million.  When confronted by community members they took advantage of, the brothers denied their financial losses and never returned the money they stole.  “When victims asked for their money back, [Sassi Mizrahi] gaslit them with lies about the safety of their investments, promises of repayment he knew could not be honored, threats of retaliation, and forged documents meant to corroborate his increasingly baroque excuses for why the money was unavailable,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also obtained a   of more than $3 million against Motty and MBIG for fraud in Oct. 2020. Motty’s sentence hearing is scheduled for Dec. 18. "},

These are the key questions and answers on consumer rights. I am in Iceland. Will I be able to leave?  reports:  ,  When Independent reporter Barney Davis visited the   last week, he discovered an old fishing town which looked set to add tourism to its bow of strings to offer. As enormous craters still dominate the centre of the town, there’s already thoughts to how this will play out if the eruption happens, or not. Snorri Valsson, Iceland’s spokesperson, led the first tour of Grindavík for the world’s media during a blistering hailstorm. And he said: “Grindavík is the quintessential fishing town that has been Iceland’s backbone throughout the centuries. It has an excellent museum already on the tradition of salted fish making, for example. “But I see an increase in tourists coming certainly since the earthquake because the infrastructure will be repaired and there’s a history of the events of recent days. “I could imagine it could be a focus point of the visitor’s centre for years to come because of these events and the effect it had on town life. For Iceland’s economy, it is extremely important Grindavík gets back to normal it has impacted the decisions of the central bank already.”  ,   ,   ,   ,  Earthquakes shook a church bell in Grindavik like a “warning from God”, a resident has said. “The earthquakes went on for hours getting worse and worse, the church bells were ringing so loudly it was like a warning from God,” Erling Snær told The Independent. “We’ve had a lot of news in this town but I hope this time people are looking into it, and will make changes because it is so hard to leave your home. “It’s hard to think about tourists coming to look at the crack today. But for now I don’t think they will. It’s all so soon. I still believe that something will erupt.”  ,  A Grindavik resident has told how she tried to have a look at the craters but was blocked by workers. Margaret Eyjolfsdottir, 55, walked her normally skittish whippet Lady on their normal route and seemed reassured in the setting sun, declaring emphatically: “We are going nowhere, this is our home. “ I wanted to go over and see the damage but they wouldn’t let me near. I think she [points to Lady] understands that it is all over. She is calm and so am I.”  ,  The crater in Grindavik will become Iceland’s number one “selfie spot”, a volunteer rescue worker has predicted. “I think it will definitely become the number one selfie spot in Iceland,” he told The Independent. “If you put up a fish and chip store right there it will do so well. The English will love it there. It is an amazing thing that nobody was injured. “Everyone is doing differently, some people are really angry others are really happy their homes aren’t damaged.”  ,  A seismologist has said the decision on whether to return residents to Grindavik is an incredibly “difficult” one that he would not like to be making himself. “The decision to move back is going to be a very difficult one and I don’t want to make it,” professor Páll Einarsson told The Independent “Every day now brings a new situation. The last eruption was 1214 since then none until 2021 which is 800 years of slumber.” He added: “We may now be at the beginning of an active volcanic period for the next two or three centuries.”  ,  The risk of a volcanic eruption threatening Grindavik has subsided but has not completely disappeared, a seismologist has said. “This dyke looks like it could solidify underground and not make it to the surface and that is the most favourable option for the people living there,” Professor Páll Einarsson, who was brought out of retirement to study the thousands of earthquakes rocking the town, told The Independent. “But the worst case scenario is the magma-filled crack reaches the surface in the middle of the town between the houses of Grindavík. If that eruption continues for the same time it will be wiped out. “We have to keep in mind this is not just one dyke that is scaring people right now - it is a new chapter of a long story. We’ve had three eruptions already this story is not going to end with this dyke.”  ,  Grindavik can make something “positive” out of the recent earthquake, Iceland’s tourism department has said, suggesting some of the damage to infrastructure could be turned into a tourist attraction. “When we have destruction from the eruption in the Westman Islands 50 years ago they kept some of the ruins intact,” Snorri Valsson, Iceland’s spokesperson for tourism, told The Independent. “So most of the damages were repaired but there were sights in town where you could see the actual destruction, houses half covered under lava and ash. So I can imagine they will keep a couple of sights where you could see the actual crack in the ground if it is feasible. It will become an outdoor example, fascinating to see.” He added: “It has done some damage but I’m sure the people of Grindavík can bring something positive out of it. “The people have shown incredible resilience you can see that it has had an effect on them. It’s a tight-knit community that’s going to stick together and get back on their feet again. “As you can see, travel in there is safe so everyone is welcome.”  ,  Grindavik has seen an uptick in tourists after being hit by an earthquake that caused huge craters, a tourism chief has said. “Grindavík is the quintessential fishing town that has been Iceland’s backbone throughout the centuries,” Snorri Valsson, Iceland’s spokesperson for tourism, told The Independent. “It has an excellent museum already on the tradition of salted fish making, for example.” He added: “But I see an increase in tourists coming certainly since the earthquake because the infrastructure will be repaired and there’s a history of the events of recent days. “I could imagine it could be a focus point of the visitor’s centre for years to come because of these events and the effect it had on town life. For Iceland’s economy, it is extremely important Grindavík gets back to normal it has impacted the decisions of the central bank already.”  ,  Residents of Grindavik were given unrestricted access to return to their homes on Thursday after being evacuated. Some returned to collect jet-skis, cuddly toys and other valuables, Barney Davis reports from the small fishing town. Others, however, were apparently not prepared to take any risks despite the decreasing chances of an eruption and stayed away.  ,  Icelandic authorities said on Friday they were still on alert for a volcanic eruption in the southwest Reykjanes peninsula, although the odds were falling after a drop in seismic activity. Iceland has been living with a high risk of an eruption since seismic activity and underground lava flows increased in the region near the capital Reykjavik in late October. The Metrological Office said in a statement that an eruption in or near the evacuated town of Grindavik was now seen as less likely and that volcanic magma is most likely to rise in the area between Hagafell and SÃƒÂ½lingarfell. \"Seismic activity continues to decrease,\" it said, adding that \"the likelihood of eruption decreases over time\". Five ministers from the Icelandic parliament visited Grindavik on Friday, where evacuated residents have been allowed back since Thursday to pick up more personal belongings. But it will be months before they all are able to move back to Grindavik due to infrastructure damage, Icelandic media RUV quoted public safety director Vidir Reynisson as saying. As a result of a decrease in activity since the start of the week, the risk level related to earthquakes in Grindavik was lowered from emergency to danger level on Thursday, Iceland's civil defence authority said in a statement.  ,  Hundreds of   have been rescued from  ’s town of  , after they were separated from their owners over threats of an imminent  .

One drug just cleared a key FDA hurdle, a sign the agency is ready to take longevity seriously. The injection could be available in veterinary offices by 2026. An anti-aging drug for dogs is one step closer to doctor's offices, after it cleared a key regulatory hurdle with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this month. On Tuesday,   announced that its first-of-its-kind longevity drug received the first of three green lights needed for FDA approval. The decision, made in early November, is essentially a vote of confidence from federal regulators that this drug should actually work to extend dogs' lifespans, based on evidence so far. Loyal's new drug, called LOY-001 is an injection that dogs over 7 years and 40 pounds could receive at their veterinarian's office roughly every three to six months. The goal? Add more years of healthy living onto the pets' lives, at a relatively reasonable price of \"mid double digits\" a month, Loyal CEO and founder Celine Halioua told Business Insider. Halioua expects the drug, which aims to slow down big dog growth factors, could be on the market in 2026. But if this anti-aging drug is successfully approved by the FDA, it could be a watershed moment not only for pet owners, but for  , too. This is the first time that US regulators have hinted that they could be ready to endorse longevity drugs. \"Classically, drugs are developed for diseases,\" Halioua explained. \"What the longevity field is trying to do is   holistically.\" Instead of going after one disease at a time, the new drugs that Loyal (and  ) are currently developing for longevity hope to extend the amount of time that dogs and people can be reasonably expected to live in good health. \"Extend out those healthy middle years,\" as Halioua put it.

The worst of the weather is expected Monday night: \"The lake-effect snow is expected to reach peak intensity across the entire Great Lakes from Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning,\"   meteorologist Jake Sojda said. The weather service warned that \"if traveling, be prepared for rapidly changing road conditions and visibilities.\" Most of the heavy snow should stay closer to the lakes, and parts of northern Michigan, northwestern Pennsylvania and northern New York are the most likely targets for feet of snow, according to Accuweather. The weather service said the snow is forecast to remain south of the Buffalo metro area. Lake-effect snow, which can last for only a few minutes to several days, develops from narrow bands of clouds that form when cold, dry arctic air passes over a large, relatively mild lake. These snows typically occur only in the fall or early winter, before the lakes freeze over. (But if the lakes don't freeze, lake-effect snow can occur throughout the winter and into the spring.) Wind direction is also key to determine which areas will receive lake-effect snow. Heavy snow may be falling in one spot, while the sun may be shining just a mile or two away in either direction. One of the biggest lake-effect snowfall events on record hammered areas near Buffalo, New York: 5 feet of snow in a span of two days in November 2014, AccuWeather said. Snow squalls well away from the Great Lakes are also possible into Tuesday evening, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said. \"Snow squalls are especially dangerous as they pass over high speed, busy highways, such as Interstates 79, 80 and 81 in the region, where the volume of traffic may prevent motorists from seeing the squalls coming in advance,\" he said. Squalls can occur when a strong Arctic front rolls through a region and are comparable to quick-moving summer rain showers and thunderstorms. Snow squalls have caused massive and deadly chain-reaction highway pileups in recent winters because of their brief but intense snowfall rates, which can drop visibility at a moment's notice while slickening roads. Chain-reaction accidents can kill or injure dozens of people each winter and can wreck hundreds or even thousands of cars and trucks. While snow will be the primary weather threat around the Great Lakes, below-average temperatures will continue to be the main story across much of the nation this week. \"Highs Tuesday will be in the 30s and 40s for New England, the mid-Atlantic, and even into the Carolinas, with 50s for the Southeast and Gulf Coast/north Florida,\" the  . \"Chilly highs in the 20s and 30s are expected for the Great Lakes/Midwest with 30s and 40s from the central Plains into the middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Highs will be in the 50s for Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley.\" These temperatures are about 10-20 degrees below average for this time of year. The West will also see unusually cold weather. In portions of California, a freeze warning is in effect until Thursday. \"Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing,\" the weather service warned. \"Temperatures can be dangerous to unsheltered or vulnerable pets and people.\""},

Now, amid signs that a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas due to expire on Monday may be extended, Blinken is departing for Brussels for a NATO foreign ministers meeting. In Brussels, the alliance will reaffirm its support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, explore ways of easing tensions between Kosovo and Serbia and look at preparations for NATO’s 75th anniversary next year.  ,   has unveiled what he calls  ’s new strategy to counter Western dominance of the field of artifical intelligence, claiming that new   models “cancel Russian culture”. The president addressed an AI conference in Moscow on Friday where he said Russian investment in AI development was being increased across all sectors. Citing the example of Gazprom Neft, Mr Putin said one of Russia’s largest oil producers was using AI to slash the cost of oil well development and to address complicated logistics safety issues.  ,   has likely been forced to move several air defence systems from its   enclave on the   coast to the frontline in Ukraine amid the losses it has suffered there, according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). Vladimir Putin appears to have been left with no choice but to weaken the defences of   an outpost bordered by Nato members on three sides and considered one of Moscow’s most  “Exceptional Russian air transport movements through November 2023 suggest that Russia has likely moved strategic air defence systems from its Baltic coast enclave of Kaliningrad, to  ,” the MoD said in its latest intelligence update on Sunday.  ,  More than half a million people were left without power in  , Russia and   after a storm in the   area flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines, Russian state news agency Tass and Ukraine’s energy ministry said. Meanwhile, the   region experienced its heaviest snowfall in 40 years, the governor said. The storms and snowfall were part of a weather front that left one person dead and many places without electricity amid heavy snow and blizzards in   and Moldova on Sunday. The head of Russia’s national meteorological service said the storm that hit Crimea was the most powerful since record keeping began, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.  ,   Majority Leader   has announced that he’s set to bring a spending package connecting funding for   and   to the   “One of the most important tasks we must finish is taking up and passing a funding bill to ensure we as well as our friends and partners in Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific region have the necessary military capabilities to confront and deter our adversaries and competitors”. – Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker   – have argued that any Republican backing of aid to Ukraine must be tied to restricting immigration,   noted. Mr Schumer said talks regarding the border issue had gone on over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  ,  The shelves at   supermarkets are full of fruit and vegetables, cheese and meat. But many of the shoppers look at the selection with dismay  Russia’s Central Bank has raised its key lending rate four times this year to try to get inflation under control and stabilize the ruble’s exchange rate as the economy weathers the effects of Russia’s military operation in   and the Western sanctions imposed as a consequence. The last time it raised the rate — to 15%, doubled that from the beginning of the year — the bank said it was concerned about prices that were increasing at an annualized pace of about 12%. The bank now forecasts inflation for the full year, as well as next year, to be about 7.5%.  ,  Russia said on Monday there would be no meeting between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at an OSCE meeting in North Macedonia this week. Lavrov had said earlier he would join the foreign ministers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which includes Canada and the United States, in Skopje if Bulgaria opened its air space for him. He said some Western countries had requested meetings with him. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the West has sought to isolate Russia, and face-to-face meetings between senior ministers have been rare. But in response to a question at the same Primakov Readings foreign policy forum, the TASS news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying Washington had not requested a meeting “and will not request one. And there will be no meeting”. The meeting of the 57-member OSCE, which is intended to prevent conflict and security crises, takes place from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. “Apparently Bulgaria has promised Macedonia it will open its air space - if that happens then we will be there. Let’s see,” Lavrov said. “There are already several requests for meetings - including from Western representatives,” Lavrov said, without naming any countries.  ,   has reportedly pardoned two Russian men convicted of   after they deployed to the frontline in the war with  . One of the men, Denis Gorin, was recruited into a private military company after signing a contract with the Russian ministry of defence but is known to have been convicted thrice for murdering at least four people between 2003 and 2022. He was also convicted of eating the remains of his victims along with his brother,  a news outlet aligned with Radio Free Europe. He is the 17th person convicted for murder to be pardoned by the Russian president between 2022 and 2023. “At the trial, he (Gorin) admitted that they ate the murdered man who was their acquaintance,” said his neighbour Dmitry Vladimirovich.  ,   President   on Friday announced a plan to endorse a national strategy for the development of artificial intelligence, emphasizing that it’s essential to prevent a Western monopoly. Speaking at an AI conference in  , Putin noted that “it’s imperative to use Russian solutions in the field of creating reliable and transparent artificial intelligence systems that are also safe for humans.” “Monopolistic dominance of such foreign technology in Russia is unacceptable, dangerous and inadmissible,” Putin said.  ,  In audio intercepts from the front lines in  , Russian soldiers speak in shorthand of 200s to mean dead, 300s to mean wounded. The urge to flee has become common enough that they also talk of 500s —   who refuse to fight.  a growing number of Russian soldiers want out, as suggested in secret recordings obtained by The Associated Press of Russian soldiers calling home from the battlefields of the  ,   and   regions in Ukraine. The calls offer a rare glimpse of the war as it looked through Russian eyes — a point of view that seldom makes its way into Western media, largely because Russia has made it a crime to speak honestly about the conflict in Ukraine. They also show clearly how the war has progressed, from the professional soldiers who initially powered  ’s full-scale invasion to men from all walks of life compelled to serve in grueling conditions.  ,  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is turning his attention to Ukraine, NATO and the Western Balkans after weeks of intense focus on Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Now, with the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas extended for two more days, Blinken departed Monday for Brussels for a NATO foreign ministers meeting.In Brussels, the alliance will reaffirm its support for Ukraine‘s defense against Russia‘s invasion, explore ways of easing tensions between Kosovo and Serbia and look at preparations for NATO’s 75th anniversary next year. The two-day session on Tuesday and Wednesday will include the first foreign minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a body created by alliance leaders at their last summit to improve cooperation and coordination and help prepare Kyiv for eventual membership. “Allies will continue to support Ukraine‘s self-defense until Russia stops its war of aggression,” said Jim O’Brien, the top U.S. diplomat for Europe. In a call with reporters on Monday, O’Brien said Blinken may travel to Skopje, North Macedonia, after Brussels for a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  ,  Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a national budget for the next three years that increases spending by around 25% and reportedly devotes a record amount to defence as the country’s military operation in Ukraine drags on. The budget foresees spending in 2024 of 36.6 trillion roubles with an expected deficit of 1.595 trillion roubles. After the budget was passed by the lower house of the parliament, speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said it was developed specifically to fund the military and to mitigate the impact of international sanctions imposed after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Record low unemployment, higher wages and targeted social spending should help the Kremlin ride out the domestic impact of pivoting the economy towards the military, but could pose a problem in the long term, analysts say. Part of the Russian budget is secret as the Kremlin tries to conceal its military plans and sidestep scrutiny of its operation in Ukraine. But independent business journalists Farida Rustamova and Maksim Tovkaylo said this month that around 39% of all federal spending will go towards defence and law enforcement in 2024.  ,   ,  More measures may soon be taken by Finland to stop a surge in asylum seekers crossing the border from Russia. Some 900 asylum seekers from nations including Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen have entered Finland from Russia in November. Finland say the increase is an orchestrated move by Moscow in retaliation for its decision to increase defence cooperation with the United States “Intelligence information from different sources tells us that there still are people on the move ... If this continues, more measures will be announced in the near future,” Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told a press conference. Several Finnish media outlets have reported that the government had held talks over closing the whole border.  ,  We mentioned earlier about ancient artefacts from Russian-occupied Crimea being sent to Ukraine by a Dutch museum. They include precious items such as a solid gold Scythian helmet and golden neck ornament, and were on loan to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum when Russian troops seized and annexed the peninsula in 2014. Now we’re seeing video on social media of a truck carrying the items coming into Ukraine Scythian gold is already in Ukraine! A truck with 2,694 kg of cultural property entered the territory of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, where Kyiv customs officers will identify the treasures in the Treasury of the National Museum of Ukraine.  — Oleksiy Goncharenko (@GoncharenkoUa)   ,  Russian news agency TASS is reporting that four people have now died in severe cold weather in Russian-occupied Crimea. Emergency conditions have been declared in the Crimean Peninsula, Tatyana Lyubetskaya, a Russia-installed official at the region’s environmental monitoring department, told the news agency. It follows a weekend storm that pounded the Black Sea region toppled trees, tore down power lines and flooded coastal areas. More than half a million people were without power on Monday morning. The storms were part of a weather system that created blizzard-like conditions in Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria and Serbia on Sunday.  ,  Polish truckers and farmers today started a round-the-clock blockade of access to one of the busiest border crossings with Ukraine. The truckers, now blocking the Medyka crossing as well as three other border crossings, complain they are losing out to Ukrainian companies which offer cheaper prices for their services and which are transporting goods within the European Union. Tomasz Borkowski, leader of the Committee to Protect Transporters and Transport Employers, a Polish union, said: “I would like to end this protest as soon as possible, because it is as burdensome for us as for everyone around us. “We have no intention of giving up and we will stand until we get our terms.” The protest started on November 6, with truckers demanding the EU bring in a permit system for Ukrainian truckers to ensure fair competition.  ,  The factory is believed to employ around 30,000 people, and produces two of Russia’s most advanced main battle tank systems; T-72 and T-90 tanks. On Monday morning, Russia’s emergencies ministry said the fire was under control. Although it was reported that residents nearby were still without water and power.  ,  If the fire was responsibilty of Ukraine, it would be its furthest attack behind enemy lines of the war so far. Russian officials have said it was caused by a short circuit.  ,  Ancient artefacts from Russian-occupied Crimea have been sent to Ukraine by a Dutch museum. More than 1,000 Scythian artefacts, including a solid gold Scythian helmet and golden neck ornament, were on loan to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum when Russian troops seized and annexed the peninsula in 2014. Now, following a legal dispute over ownership rights between Ukraine and the Moscow-contolled territory, 565 of the items have been sent to Kyiv. They date from when the Scythian people lived in the area between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC. “This was a special case, in which cultural heritage became a victim of geopolitical developments,” said Els van der Plas, director of the Allard Pierson. “We are pleased that clarity has emerged and that they have now been returned.” It comes after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by TASS state news agency as saying the artefacts “belong to Crimea and should be there”.  ,  More than 2,000 towns and villages across Ukraine have been hit by power cuts after heavy snow  ,  After weeks of intense focus on the Israel’s war against  , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be putting Ukraine at the top of the agenda in a meeting with NATO foreign ministers this week. Mr Blinken will join the two-day sessions in Brussells tomorrow and on Wednesday, with the alliance expected to reaffirm its support for   against Russia’s invasion. “Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s self-defence until Russia stops its war of aggression,” said Jim O’Brien, the top US diplomat for Europe. The session will alos see the first foreign minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a body created by alliance leaders at their last summit to improve cooperation and coordination and help prepare Kyiv for eventual membership. The meeting will come amid continued fighting between Kyiv and Moscow - with both facing worsening weather conditions.  ,  The UN’s nuclear agency has today reported hearing several rockets appearing to have been fired closed to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. It is believed they were fired from a multiple launch rocket system nearby. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: “Today’s events once again clearly demonstrate the extremely fragile nuclear safety and security situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – located on the frontline – continues to face many potential threats as a result of this tragic war, “I remain deeply concerned about nuclear safety and security at the plant, both when it comes to its vulnerable off-site power supplies – which can be affected by attacks far away from the site – and the more direct military risks it is facing, potentially undermining the principals hat I set out at the United Nations Security Council in May. In this context, the apparent firing of rockets from near the plant is a special source of concern.”  ,  Appearing to back the data on Russian casualties reported by the UK’s Ministry of Defence today, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has said Ukraine is inflicting huge losses for the Russians in recent weeks. It comes as the fighting now takes place under a blanket of snow storms as winter sets in across the region. Mr Stoltenberg said: “We see high casualty numbers and some of the most intense fightings that we have seen throughout the whole war has actually taken place over the last weeks and couple of months. “Again we are impressed by the bravery, the competence of the Ukrainian forces, and also their ability to actually strike behind the Russian lines, deep into Russian-controlled territory. “And of course military achievements can partly be measured in square metres but also on the losses you are able to inflict on your adversary.”  ,  As Russia continues its attack on almost all sides of the eastern city of Avdiivka, we’re now hearing more on the number of injuries on the Moscow side. A briefing from Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Ukraine’s estimate on the number of daily Russian casualties has increased from 776 in March to 931 this month. It said: “Although Defence Intelligence cannot verify the methodology, taken as a total including both killed and wounded, the figures are plausible. “The last six weeks have likely seen some of the highest Russian casualty rates of the war so far. “The heavy losses have largely been caused by Russia’s offensive against the Donbas town of Avdiivka.”  ,  Mr Shapps did not hold back in his response to new figures published on the number of Russian casualties. The figures, from the Ukgrainian General Staff and described as “plausible” by the UK’s Ministry of Defence showed an average 931 Ukrainian soldiers were killed or injured every day this month. Mr Shapps wrote on X: “Putin is stepping up his invasion - senselessly sending more Russians to die than at any time since the war began. Ukrainian bravery and western support is holding back their advance, but we cannot be complacent. Ukraine needs our unwavering support to fight and win.”  ,  Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky has shared pictures showing the damage caused by the severe weather to towns and villages across Ukraine. The extreme weather comes as tens of thousands of troops man front-line positions in the 21-month-old war with Russia and amid fears Moscow could target the power grid with air strikes this winter. Ukraine’s largest private energy provider, DTEK, said early on Monday that it had been able to restore power to nearly 250 villages and towns. Bad weather has caused power outages in more than 2,000 towns and villages in 16 regions of Ukraine and has also blocked road traffic. I am grateful to all rescuers, utility workers, the National Police, local authorities, and engineers working around the clock to help people.  — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)   ,  Meta spokesperson Andy Stone has been added to Russia’s wanted list on unspecified terrorism charges, according to media reports. It comes after Russia banned Facebook and Instragram in March 2022, calling parent company Meta “extremist”. Media reports say Mr Stone is wanted by Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, reported Mediazona, an independent news website that covers Russia’s opposition and prison system.  ,  “I would like to thank everyone who is working now and will continue to work tomorrow to protect us from this bad weather,” said Volodymyr Zelensky, as he praised his soldiers amid brutal winter weather conditions in the conflict with Russia. Snowstorms and high winds had left 400 settlements without power, he said. He added: “Now, when it is so difficult, in such conditions, we should all be especially grateful to those who defend our country, who carry out Ukrainian offensive operations, who are in combat positions, at combat posts, on duty in mobile fire groups and in all our other units that protect Ukraine, the life of our state and our independence.”  ,  Ukraine was hit by a severe snowstorm today, with more than 2,000 villages and towns witout power and dozens of motorways closed. The extreme weather comes as tens of thousands of troops man front-line positions in the 21-month-old war with Russia and amid fears Moscow could target the power grid with air strikes this winter. At least 1,370 cargo trucks were stuck and 840 cars had to be towed away amid snow drifts that in some places were two meters (6.56 ft) high, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on the Telegram messenger. Southern and central Ukraine were the worst hit, he said. Volodymyr Zelensky said: “I would like to thank everyone who is working now and will continue to work tomorrow to protect us from this bad weather and to restore normal living conditions in all our Ukrainian communities as soon as possible.”  ,  Almost half a million people have been left without power and one person was killed after a storm in the Black Sea area flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines in Crimea, Russian state news agency Tass said. The storm also hit southern Russia and sent waves flooding into the beach resort of Sochi, blew the roof off a five-story building off in Anapa and damaged homes and schools in Kuban, the state news agency said. It was part of a weather front that earlier left one person dead and hundreds of places without electricity amid heavy snowfall and strong blizzards in Romania and Moldova on Sunday. The storm prompted several Crimean regions to declare a state of emergency after it became the strongest recorded in the past 16 years with wind speeds reaching 144 kph (almost 90 mph), Tatyana Lyubetskaya, a Russia-installed official at the Crimean environmental monitoring department, told Tass. The government in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, told people to stay at home on Monday and closed government offices including schools and hospitals as strong winds are still expected Monday.  ,  Russia is having to move several air defence systems from the Baltic Sea coast to the frontline after losses to its SA-21 air defence systems in occupied Ukraine, according to UK Ministry of Defence. Ukrainian attacks most likely destroyed at least four Russian surface-to-air missile systems that were located in occupied territories in a span of a single week, the MoD said in an earlier update on 2 November. It now appears that Putin has been forced to move the systems from Kaliningrad, which is considered one of Moscow’s mosts strategically sensitive regions.  ,  Russian armoured vehicles attacked Ukrainian positions on the south eastern part of the key city of Avdiivka on Sunday, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank. The group also says Putin’s forces have also made advances in the town of Krasnohorivka, around four miles north of Avdiivka. The attacks illustrate the focus of Russian forces on capturing the city, which is 13 miles north of Donetsk and was an industrial centre before the war.  ,  The shelves at   supermarkets are full of fruit and vegetables, cheese and meat.

His statement comes amid reports of Russian troops suffering “some of the highest” casualties of the conflict so far amid intense fighting in eastern Ukraine. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) on Monday said Russia was losing an average of 931 men a day this month, largely in the fight for the . Until now the heaviest casualties suffered in a month by Russia – according to Ukrainian data – was March this year, with an average of 776 losses per day during the push to capture Bakhmut. \"They (the Chechen fighters) have the best equipment and modern weapons,\" Mr Kadyrov claimed on Telegram. \"In addition, the guys are highly combative and very motivated to achieve results,\" he added. Mr Kadyrov had earlier sent 26,000 fighters to the battlefield since the beginning of Russia's war in Ukraine last year. According to reports, 12,000 were volunteers at that time and 7,000 of them were actively fighting. These claims about Chechen deployments to Ukraine could not be independently verified, and Reuters reported that several Chechen armed formations have fought on the side of Kyiv against Russia since Mr Putin launched his invasion in February last year.

Mr Kadyrov enjoys wide leeway from Mr Putin to run Chechnya ruthlessly as his personal fiefdom, but he angered pro-Kremlin hardliners in September by praising his 15-year-old son for beating up an ethnic Russian prisoner in Chechen custody. Mr Kadyrov met the Russian president in September amid speculations over his health, with rumours swirling that he was either dead or in a coma. He later clarified that he was fine and was travelling to a hospital in Moscow to visit a \"sick uncle\". Earlier this month Mr Kadyrov said that a large group of Russia's former Wagner mercenaries, who had played a prominent role in some of the fiercest fighting in Ukraine before their group fell into disarray after a  , had also started training with special forces from Chechnya. Mr Kadyrov, 47, has mused publicly about handing over power at some point and appears to be actively working to raise the profile of his three teenage sons, the eldest of whom was photographed with Mr Putin in the Kremlin in March."},

The   happened around 1:30 p.m. on the 1700 block of W. 83rd Street in Manchester Square, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. While he was at work, David Aragon received the earth-shattering call that no parent ever wants to endure, that his daughter Alma Aragon and granddaughter Alexa Antonio Aragon had been in a serious crash and were rushed to Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Torrance.  “I came here and I asked the doctor, ‘My daughter, she’s okay?’” the grieving father told KTLA’s Omar Lewis. “They said, ‘No, she passed away.’” Alma, 26, and her daughter had been waiting at a bus stop that afternoon after picking up a gift from a relative. That’s when police say a speeding driver traveling southbound on Western Avenue collided with another driver who was exiting a liquor store parking lot.  The impact of the two vehicles set off a chain reaction, sending one car careening onto the sidewalk where the mother and daughter were struck. Alma died a short time later. “We have the individual pulling out of the liquor store who was under the influence,” Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Ryan Moreno told KTLA. “And then we have the lady who was driving at a high rate of speed in a reckless manner. So, they both will be facing manslaughter charges.”  Young Alexa was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, but ultimately succumbed to her injuries on Monday.  David is now dealing with the loss of his daughter and granddaughter, both of whom moved to the U.S. two years ago in search of a better life.  “My daughter said, ‘Oh, pappa, this is a nice place. I can work and make my money. I want to buy my house. I want to buy my car.’ Now everything changed,” he said. As of last week, LAPD said there have been 101 deadly crashes in South Centra Los Angeles alone.  “Last year, we were at 107 people killed,” Sgt. Moreno said. “ A year before that, it was 109. A 109 has been a record top year, so we were hoping to stay under this year, but now it doesn’t look like it. It looks like we will surpass more than we ever had.” With lives like young Alexa’s and her mother Alma’s cut short on a day meant for gratitude, many residents of South L.A. are hoping drivers will start doing their part to stop this from ever happening again. “It’s bad that somebody on Thanksgiving just lost their family,” one resident told KTLA. “They need to slow down.

Academics surveyed prison workers who are in custody and more than half said the number of victims in prison was likely underestimated.  have been referred for modern   support, data from January to September 2022 shows. One forensic psychologist interviewed for the report said they estimated they had seen 100 victims over the last few years and said: “It’s increasing exponentially”. One modern slavery survivor who was sent to prison told researchers that in custody “no one wanted to listen”, adding: “For so many years I was too scared to talk”. Another said putting victims . “I think that’s the quickest way, for us, being victims, it’s the quickest way to put us into prison rather than support us,” they said. Vulnerable people who are trafficked to the UK can often be forced into work at cannabis farms, in county lines drugs networks or for organised pick-pocketting gangs, researchers said.  said they pleaded guilty in court so they wouldn’t have to go back to prison but were then told by a immigration solicitor “this is so wrong, you shouldn’t be in here, you shouldn’t be in prison”. They continued: “I still have the shame of being considered as a criminal, knowing that I have never, would never even hurt a mosquito, but I’m labelled in this country as a criminal.” One victim told researchers that traffickers end up going free “whereas the people that were being forced to do this, they end up being sentenced to three years”. They continued: “I was a young child who was sent into the hands of a predator without knowing.” In some cases, asylum seeking children are picked up from Home Office hotels and “disappeared” by traffickers, a report in  found earlier this year. Fifty people who worked as modern slavery special points of contact, a role established in prisons to identify victims, were surveyed for the report. Twenty said they were aware of at least one prisoner who had been referred by officials for help as a suspected victim of modern slavery. However 33 of those surveyed said that it was likely that there were unidentified modern slavery survivors in prison. One person working in the Northern Ireland Prison Service said: “The [prison] chaplains anecdotally would tell us that a large number of foreign nationals they see claim to have been either enslaved or trafficked”. Dr Marija Jovanovic from the University of Essex, who led the study, said: “We like to think that countries deal with modern slavery by identifying and protecting survivors, whilst sending perpetrators to prisons. The reality is much more complicated, with many survivors being sent to prisons, sometimes for the crimes they were forced to commit by their traffickers, instead of being protected. “Shockingly, given how few convictions there are on modern slavery charges, it’s not out of the question that there might be more survivors than perpetrators in UK prisons”, Silvia Berastegui, from not-for-profit Hibiscus Initiatives, said that they continually see survivors of trafficking who have been “wrongly criminalisted for being forced to commit an offence”. Jakub Sobik from the Modern Slavery PEC, which funded the study, said that there was more to do to “improve identification and support for people affected by modern slavery”. The Ministry of Justice have begun a campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery among staff and published new guidance this year on how to support victims. A government spokesperson said: “Modern slavery is a heinous crime and we support thousands of victims towards their recovery every year, with courts taking it into account when sentencing. “We recognise many people entering custody are themselves victims of crime including modern slavery which is why we have rolled out clear guidelines and extra support for staff to ensure survivors get the help and trauma-informed support they need.”"},

About one in seven 14 to 17-year-olds and one in five 18 to 24-year-olds were using vapes, according to the government's data from the first quarter of 2023. The government will also introduce legislation in 2024 to prevent domestic manufacture, advertisement, supply and commercial possession of non-therapeutic and disposable vapes in an effort to control the devices across all levels of the supply chain, the health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. “All Australian governments are committed to working together to stop the disturbing growth in vaping among our young people,” the health minister said. The   government cited \"strong and consistent evidence\" to suggest that young Australians who   were around three times more likely to take up tobacco in the future. Ambitious plans to impose a ban on disposable vapes, while also increasing the taxation on tobacco, were first announced in May, though no timeline for the measures was provided then. \"Vaping was sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers quit,\" Mr Butler said at the time. \"It was not sold as a recreational product – especially not one targeted to our kids, but that is what it has become.\" He said vaping was a \"gateway to smoking\" and smoking remained one of the leading preventable causes of death and disease in the country, responsible for almost 20,000 Australian deaths each year. The government will allot an additional $25m to the Australian Border Force and $56.9m to the Therapeutic Goods Administration over two years to eliminate the rampant vaping black market.

Speaking a day after his release to an Israeli broadcaster, Yelena Magid said: “He was kidnapped by terrorists and they held inside him some kind of building... “It’s my understanding that from the bombings, the building collapsed and he managed to get out and escape. It’s a movie, this whole thing.”  ,  Video footage shared on Israeli networks showed Hadas Calderon, shrieking with joy and jumping on a chair as she was informed children, Sahar (16) and Erez (12) were in Monday’s group of releases. Their father Ofer remains in captivity and their grandmother Carmela was killed on 7 October. Also on the list were twin daughters Emma and Yuli, who, aged just three were Monday’s youngest releases. Their mother Sharon Aloni Cunion, 34, was released with them. Their husband David and brother Ariel remain in captivity. Siblings Or Yaakov, 16, and Yogi, 12 were already released, while their father Yair remains in captivity. Karina Engle-Bart, 54 who had recently recovered from breast cancer, was released with her children Mika, 18 and Yuval ,11 - the father Ronen is still a Hamas captive. Eitan Yahalomi, 12 was released on his own : his father Ohad, who was kidnaped with him, remains in Gaza. Out of the remaining hostages who are still in Gaza, 49 are from Kibbutz Nir Oz, said the head of the kibbutz Osnat Peri. Among them are women, men, children, mothers, fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers.  ,  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Israel, the West Bank and the United Arab Emirates later this week, a senior State Department official said on Monday, to press for more humanitarian aid into Gaza and help secure release of all hostages kidnapped by Hamas. “The Secretary will stress the need to sustain the increased flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, secure the release of all hostages, and improve protections for civilians in Gaza,” a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said. Blinken will also discuss with partners in the region Washington’s principles for the future of Gaza and the need for an independent Palestinian state, the official said. He will also attend the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai, the official added.  ,  The Israeli military has confirmed that 11 hostages “are now in Israeli territory” after being released by Hamas. The hostages will undergo medical assessments, the IDF said, and forces will accompany them until they are reunited with their families.  ,  The United States does not believe that there are any Americans in the latest group of hostages released by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Monday. The Israeli military said on Monday that the Red Cross confirmed 11 hostages were on their way to Israeli territory after being released by Hamas in Gaza.  ,  Residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz have confirmed that all 11 Israeli hostages to be released this evening are from our community. Out of the remaining hostages, 49 are from Nir Oz. This list includes women, men, children, mothers, fathers, grandfathers, and grandmothers. Osnat Peri, the Head of the Kibbutz says: “The news this evening brings a sigh of relief to our community, however we remain deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage.

Out of the remaining hostages, 49 are from Nir Oz. This list includes women, men, children, mothers, fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers. Osnat Peri, the Head of the Kibbutz says: “The news this evening brings a sigh of relief to our community, however we remain deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage. We demand the return of all hostages, immediately, whatever it takes.”  ,  A two-day extension of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas offers the chance to free further hostages, a Foreign Office minister has said. Andrew Mitchell received reports of the deal while answering questions in the House of Commons and having previously insisted that the pause in hostilities “should not be a one-off”. Addressing the chamber, he said: “There is some suggestion that while I’ve been on my feet in the House, Qatar has announced a truce would be extended by two days. “Obviously, we all hope that is true and that more hostages, as a result, will be able to leave.”  ,  The White House said U.S. officials hope two American women would be among those freed from Gaza, where it believes eight or nine U.S. citizens are being held. Only one American-Israeli citizen, four-year-old Avigail Idan, has been released so far. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it had notified the families of hostages due to be released on Monday, without specifying a number. Netanyahu had said at the weekend that once the truce ended, “We will return with full force to achieve our goals: the elimination of Hamas; ensuring that Gaza does not return to what it was; and of course the release of all our hostages.”  ,  The suspect in the shooting of three college students of Palestinian descent in Vermont over the weekend pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted second-degree murder on Monday and was ordered by a judge to be held without bond. The suspect, Jason J. Eaton, 48, appeared at an arraignment at the Chittenden County Criminal Court in Burlington via a remote video feed from the county jail, where he has been held since his arrest on Sunday. The attack is under investigation by local and federal authorities as a suspected hate-motivated crime. At the time of the shooting, two of the victims were wearing a keffiyeh, the traditional black-and-white checkered head scarf commonly worn in the Middle East, police said. Police say Eaton used a pistol to shoot them on the street near the University of Vermont in Burlington on Saturday evening and then ran away. All three remained under medical care on Monday, two with gunshot wounds in their torsos and one shot in the lower extremities. Two were in stable condition, while one has sustained much more serious injuries, police said.  ,  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described an extended truce between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas on Monday as “a glimpse of hope and humanity,” but warned it was not enough time to meet the aid needs of the Gaza Strip. Mediator Qatar said on Monday that the initial four day truce had been extended by two days, continuing a pause in seven weeks of warfare that has killed thousands and laid waste to the Palestinian enclave. “I strongly hope that this will enable us to increase even more the humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza that (are) suffering so much - knowing that even with that additional amount of time, it will be impossible to satisfy all the dramatic needs of the population,” Guterres told reporters.  ,  A day after 4-year-old Israeli American hostage Avigail Edan was released by Hamas, her family has given an update on the girl’s well-being. “Avigail is still being evaluated at Schneider Children’s Medical Center, where she was taken immediately upon her release,” the statement said. The girl is “safe” and being looked after by her aunt, uncle and grandparents, the statement said. Her parents were killed in Hamas’ Oct. 7 incursion into Israel.  ,  The two-day extension of the truce between Israel and Hamas will not go into effect until the hostages set to be released on Monday are freed, according to Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israel's prime minister. Regev confirmed that a truce extension had been reached and under the agreement, Hamas would release 10 hostages each day. “For every 10 hostages released, we're willing to give an extension of another day, and if Hamas will release Israeli hostages as agreed we will extend — that's the bottom line,” Mr Regev said. Regev said he believes the hostages released over the next two days would be women and children. The senior adviser credited US President Joe Biden for helping arrange the parameters of the deal. “These were negotiated with the help of President Biden and we thank him for putting his effort and his office behind these arrangements. I don't think we would have reached the deal without his input,” he said.  ,  An   hostage   in   managed to esacape his   kidnappers for a few days before being recaptured, his family have said. Roni Krivoi, 25, who is also a Russian citizen, spent four days alone in Gaza according to his aunt, after escaping the building where he was held after it was bombed in an airstrike. Unable to find his way to the border he Hamas eventually retook him.

Appearing at   on Monday, the 46-year-old, who had been working at the yard for just three days when he lit the blaze, was jailed for   after admitting to   being reckless as to whether life is endangered. The fire was so severe it destroyed a huge shed as well as boats moored nearby and caused dozens of residents to be evacuated from their homes. The rebuild is estimated to cost £2.6 million and would take three years to complete, adding another £200,000 in lost revenue. Gregory Gordon, prosecuting, said forensic examiners had concluded an accelerant had been used to the start the fire and within 15 minutes it had quickly spread. He said Boyd-Stevenson had then watched the fire from the   where he took a photo and sent it by WhatsApp to Underfall Yard’s managing director. He also carried out internet news searches for articles about the arson and contacted a woman he had been having an extramarital affair with, asking to meet her, the court was told. Investigations found Boyd-Stevenson had accessed pornography on a computer at the yard and had opened a document about the alarm system. There was also money missing. The fire also caused a power outage in the sluice gates of Bristol Harbour, which if they had failed could have caused “catastrophic damage” to the harbour walls, Mr Gordon said. The Grade II-listed boatyard dates from 1809 and many of the original Victorian-era buildings remain to this day. Mr Gordon said: “It is a nationally historic, important site.” At a previous hearing, the defendant, of Headford Road, Knowle, Bristol, admitted arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered. The court heard that Boyd-Stevenson has previous convictions for arson and bomb hoaxes dating back to 1997 and served an 11-year sentence for similar crimes. Jenny Tallentire, defending, said: “He is not oblivious to the consequences of his actions. It follows a pattern that he has followed throughout his life. In an emotional breakdown in his life, he acts in the way he has. “It is unusual and concerning and a dangerous trait.” Judge Martin Picton imposed a life sentence with a minimum term of six years’ imprisonment after concluding Boyd-Stevenson posed a risk to the public from further offending. “It appears when things in your life are going wrong you react by starting fires or making bomb hoaxes,” the judge said. “It has happened with significant frequency to give rise to the concern you are highly likely to do so again – you are clearly dangerous. “The trauma for those whose homes were put at risk must have been considerable.

{"title": "Americans ditched big cities during the pandemic. Now many are regretting it.", "author": null, "timestamp": null, "content": "Susan, a 30-something artist, lived in New York City when the pandemic struck. Eager to flee the claustrophobia of a too-small apartment, she and her husband decamped upstate to stay with friends in an up-and-coming town in the Catskills (population: 1,000) where they could hike local trails and fish for trout. Susan, who asked that her real name not be used to avoid social repercussions, had lived in New York City for over a decade, but her husband had grown tired of the hustle and bustle of the city. The pair had talked about moving to a smaller town someday — the pandemic just shortened their timeline. Thanks to the influx of city folk desperate for personal space, rents in trendy upstate communities had become exorbitant overnight, so it made more financial sense to simply buy. The couple put in an offer on a home near their friends in April 2020 and moved in by summer's end. But once they had settled in, the reality of the situation hit Susan. Cut off from her social and creative communities, she felt unmoored and alienated. Maybe she wasn't the sort of person who enjoyed trout fishing. Maybe the house in the country wasn't right for her, after all — or at least, not yet. \"I liked the idea in theory, but I wasn't ready for it,\" Susan told me. Susan's story might sound familiar. Since the start of last year, a steady stream of news  , Reddit  , and market-research   has shown that a significant share of people who made big moves during the pandemic now  . As rent prices in big cities shot up and jobs went remote, cash-strapped people were quick to take advantage of an unprecedented situation and  . Maybe, like Susan, they had been planning a move for a while. Or maybe they just wanted to live somewhere more affordable. Regardless of the initial reasons, reality has clearly smacked many of these people in the face. For many millennial homebuyers in particular, they relocated from cities to the suburbs and semirural areas where homes were cheaper but further away from the social and professional networks they'd cultivated throughout their young adulthoods. Some have   into their new communities. Many feel   from their identities, hobbies, and the friends they left behind. The thread running through many of these stories is the pursuit of a dream that turned out to be nothing like what was expected — the dream of a three-bedroom house with a covered front porch and enough yard for a few kids and a dog to play safely, close to nature and far from city noise. But what many Americans are coming to realize is that there are no good options. As everything gets more expensive and it gets harder to make new friends, deciding where to live is a multilayered compromise. The story usually went like this: Young people would move to the city in their early 20s to start their careers and meet people. Then, as they hit their mid-20s to early 30s, they would get married, settle down in the suburbs, and start having kids. Around a decade ago, the oldest millennials disrupted that trend. Riordan Frost, a senior research analyst at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, said fewer people in their 30s (specifically, those born between 1977 and 1986) moved to the suburbs between 2011 and 2021 than people of a similar age did in previous decades. Millennials are consistently more likely than their predecessors to reside in cities, a trend that some demographers attribute to millennials' \"delay\" in achieving major milestones like getting married, having kids, and buying their first home. Coming of age in the aftermath of the 2008 recession was a challenge, but when millennials \"catch up,\" the theory goes, they'll follow suit and pack up to the land of McMansions and cul-de-sacs. As big-city rents go up, that seems to be a significant motivation behind many pandemic moves: People hunting for more space at a price they can afford. That's exactly what some millennials did when the pandemic hit. And when they fled cities for the suburbs, they went all out. Far out. \"We kind of thought that they would be going to more urbanized suburban areas, places that are technically suburban but more urban in character,\" Frost, who published a research   on the subject in March, said. \"But we found that they were primarily going out to these farther-flung, more peripheral suburban areas.\" Leading the charge were older millennial homebuyers.   found that between 2020 and 2021, 54% of homebuyers between the ages of 31 and 40 bought homes in a suburb or subdivision, while 31% opted to buy in a small town or rural area. The overwhelming majority of the properties they purchased — 88% — were single-family, detached homes. The people who left cities with fewer large apartments and houses tended to move to the outer limits of their metro areas, Frost and his colleagues found. Though their analysis did not explicitly look at the reasons behind the trend, Frost hypothesizes that cost is a significant factor. \"When people are buying houses, they're more likely to be going farther out because they're trying to get something they can afford,\" he said. As big-city rents go up, that seems to be a significant motivation behind many pandemic moves: People hunting for more space at a price they can afford. But as the moving frenzy has subsided and returned to pre-pandemic levels, many pandemic movers — millennials and other generations alike — are getting a more clear-eyed view of what they signed up for. Alex Gatien, a 38-year-old city planner, left Toronto in May 2021 for a much smaller Canadian city 270 miles east, perched on the St. Lawrence River and within minutes of the US border. Though he moved for a job, the cost of living in Toronto had become untenable. Over the years, he's watched as more and more of his friends have been priced out of the city,   that became especially pronounced early in the pandemic. For less than the cost of a studio condo in Toronto, Gatien and his partner purchased a four-bedroom Victorian with a large yard in their new city's historic downtown. In a perverse twist of fate, the American ideal of having a single-family house of your own — complete with a large, private lot — has made it harder for people to purchase any kind of home. On paper, they're living the homeownership dream. In reality, the suburbanized small-city lifestyle feels a lot more like a trade-off. \"People live in a much more private realm,\" Gatien told me. \"Everyone drives everywhere, which means you don't really run into people. They don't really use public spaces like parks unless they don't have their own outdoor space, which everyone does unless they're poor.\" Though he knew what he was signing up for and he appreciates the low cost of living, Gatien laments what he gave up for it.  to the US, and the dilemma Gatien faced is the same that more Americans are reckoning with. Remote work opened up a Pandora's box of places to call home. And all sorts of factors, from weather to proximity to family (some of them contradictory), influence people's decisions about where to settle down. But even when you carefully weigh your options, do your research, and make a thoughtful decision, the reality of a barren housing market can be disappointing. For many, the only real options are rife with compromise. And it's partly a problem of our own making. In a perverse twist of fate, the American ideal of having a single-family house of your own — complete with a large, private lot — has made it harder for people to purchase  kind of home, which in turn, has led more people to leave big cities for more affordable locales. Take Susan, the New York artist. Her move upstate was motivated both by circumstance and economic pragmatism, and predicated on giving up big city life for the slower pace of the country. It was also a favor to her husband, who never felt at peace in the bustle of the big city. But once the deal was done and she got over the initial shock, she warmed up to what she describes as \"the fantasy\" of having a house with a backyard that is close to nature, especially if and when she and her husband decide to start a family. \"It wasn't one that either of us were pursuing wholeheartedly, but once we made the move, we liked the potential,\" she said about being able to start a family. That ideal is more deeply entrenched in American culture — and its housing policies — than you might think. \"In American history, the desire for an independently owned house with at least an excuse for a yard goes way back, at least to the late 1700s,\" said Alexander von Hoffman, an urban planner and historian also with Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. As cities grew and their economies expanded, densely packed row housing and multiunit developments sprung up to accommodate the people who worked in the ports, railways, and industrial facilities that those cities were built around. \"As early as the early 1800s, the housing market fragmented by the ability to pay,\" von Hoffman continued. \"Even at the low end of the market, where possible, there has always been a propensity to own a house, preferably detached, with a yard.\" It's perfectly reasonable for people to want to have a stable, comfortable, safe living environment, but so does everybody else.Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health This stubborn adherence to an ideal of single-family property ownership in place of denser housing gave rise to the restrictive residential-zoning laws and caps on new affordable-housing builds that are  . Some would call it  . Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, uses the phrase \" .\" \"It's perfectly reasonable for people to want to have a stable, comfortable, safe living environment, but so does everybody else, and what we want for ourselves should not come at the expense of what we should want collectively,\" Galea told me. Another byproduct of both rigid zoning policies and suburban norms is the decades-long decline of \" ,\" such as coffee shops and public libraries, where people can hang out and meet others. Without spaces like these to gather, it can be especially difficult for recent transplants to   in their communities. Both those who stay in the cities and watch their rent skyrocket and those who choose to go someplace more affordable are feeling the weight of the same dilemma. Do you stay in the small, expensive apartment that is close to friends? Or do you give that up for the often-lonely dream of a single-family home? For Susan, the benefits of country life never quite made up for the costs. A few months ago, she and her husband found a renter for their house and returned to the city. She said that subletting an apartment in the city that she could imagine herself living in a decade ago sometimes feels like a step backward. And she's not sure how long they'll stay before going back upstate. On the other hand, she feels like herself for the first time in years. Read the original article on "},

Here's everything we know about the truce that's been extended 2 more days.", "author": "Kate Murphy", "timestamp": null, "content": "Eleven more Israeli hostages   in exchange for 33 Palestinian prisoners on Monday as part of the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas, Qatari officials said. Both sides have agreed to extend the truce for two more days. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have engaged in intense negotiations in hopes of prolonging the truce. “In order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days,” John Kirby, National Security Council spokesperson, told reporters on Monday. “We would, of course, hope to see the pause extended further, and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages.” Israel also agreed to allow more aid into Gaza, and said it will release three Palestinian prisoners for every additional hostage released — the same terms it followed in the four-day agreement. Despite the truce, Israel has said it will continue the war “with full military power” after Hamas launched its brutal attack on Israel on Oct. 7. “We will not stop until we achieve our goals: the destruction of Hamas and bringing home the hostages from Gaza to Israel,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said last week after the pause was announced. Here’s what we know about the ongoing hostage and prisoner release. On Monday, 11 of the roughly 240 hostages being held by Hamas were released and are back in Israel, the International Red Cross said. This brings the total number of Israeli hostages released as part of this four-day truce to 69. In addition to this weekend’s hostage release, four hostages — two U.S. citizens and two Israeli women — were released on two separate occasions in October. This means a total of 73 hostages have been released since the Israel-Hamas war started seven weeks ago. The 11 hostages released by Hamas to the International Red Cross on Monday did not include any Americans, but did include three French citizens, two German citizens and six Argentinian citizens,   from a spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Ministry. Among the 58 hostages released over the weekend were 40 Israelis, some of whom are dual nationals, 17 Thai citizens and one Philippine citizen. The youngest hostage released over the weekend was  , a 4-year-old dual Israeli-American citizen whose parents were killed by Hamas in her home on Oct. 7. Abigail was reportedly in her father’s arms when he was shot by Hamas. Covered in his blood, she crawled out from under his body and ran to a neighbor’s house. Released in the second swap over the weekend was   who turned 9 years old while in captivity and was initially believed to have been killed by Hamas. Her father, Thomas Hand, expressed relief at the time, telling CNN: “I knew the alternative for my daughter. I knew she'd either be found dead or kidnapped and taken to Gaza. … The thought of a little eight-year-old child in the hands of those animals. Can you imagine the sheer horror for an eight-year-old child?” A few weeks later he heard his daughter might be alive after Israeli authorities told him they didn’t find her remains. One hostage, 13-year-old Hila Rotem, was released over the weekend — but without her mother, Raya, who is still being held by Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces said children being released without their mothers violates the terms of the truce deal. While most of the freed hostages appeared to be in good, stable physical condition, at least two needed serious medical attention,  . Alma Abraham, 84, had a preexisting condition that was not treated properly in captivity and was rushed to an Israeli hospital in Beersheba with life-threatening conditions.   There are believed to be around   still in Gaza being held by Hamas; some are believed to be held by smaller militant groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The U.S. believes there are fewer than 10 Americans still being held. “Probably in the neighborhood of about eight to nine. We don’t necessarily have firm, solid information on each and every one of them,” Kirby told reporters Monday. He added that there’s no clarity on whether they’re being held by Hamas or other groups. So far, Israel has released 117 Palestinian women and teens who were being held in Israeli jails on   over the weekend in the occupied West Bank, with an additional 33 to be released on Monday. The alleged offenses range from stone-throwing to supporting terrorism to attempted murder. A record-high number of Palestinians are being held in administrative detention, without a trial,  .

Hay on Dec. 10, 1927. \"Following an NBC broadcast of Walter Damrosch's Music Appreciation Hour [a classical music program], Hay proclaimed on-air, ‘For the past hour we have been listening to the music taken largely from the Grand Opera, but from now on we will present the grand ole opry,'\" writes the Opry website in its history of the moment that reshaped the future of American music. Hay's turn of phrase, \"grand ole opry,\" affecting a rural southern American accent, resonated with listeners and proved an instant sensation. The Barn Dance broadcast was soon renamed the Grand Ole Opry — and has been going strong ever since. Hay \"was a remarkable visionary and colorful romantic who played a vital role in the commercializing and  ,\" writes the Country Music Hall of Fame. The Grand Ole Opry was originally broadcast from the fifth-floor radio station studio of the National Life & Accident Insurance Company in Nashville. The growth of the Opry surged in 1932, when WSM, the first clear-channel station in Tennessee, added a 50,000-watt transmitter. The new technology made WSM \"a nation-spanning giant,\" says the station's website. Now, the Grand Ole Opry could be heard across large swaths of the country, far beyond its Nashville home. It became a national institution. The broadcast grew so popular that it moved to the Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville in 1943. The Grand Ole Opry built its own theater and country-music campus, Opryland, in 1974, about 10 miles east of the city center. The Opryland theater is still a showcase for American songcraft today, ranging from tradition Appalachian fiddlers to the top hit-makers in contemporary country music. \"Both the Grand Ole Opry and the National Barn Dance aired on Saturday nights and featured folk music, fiddling, and the relatively new genre of country-western music,\" reports History.com. \"Both shows created a growing audience for a uniquely American style of music and were launching grounds for many of America’s most-loved musicians — the   got his first big break on the National Barn Dance.\" Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and   all generated national acclaim from early-career performances at the Grand Ole Opry. A statue of Lynn,  , stands outside Ryman Auditorium today. Cash, as an unknown teenager in 1950, famously met future wife June Carter, already a celebrated country-music performer, backstage at Ryman Auditorium. Their relationship would become one of the most celebrated romances in American pop-culture history. Guinness World Records recognized the Grand Ole Opry as the world's longest-running broadcast in 2004. The unique name Grand Ole Opry, created in a moment of inspiration by host Hay, solidified the broadcast's rural American identity that's been so critical to its success. \"Hay had a very romantic and nostalgic vision of rural life, music and culture, and he carefully cultivated that in the early Opry programming,\" Opry archivist Jen Larson told Fox News Digital.

Lara MacLean has been a \"puppet wrangler\" for The Jim Henson Company for three decades, per  . The company's co-founder, Jim Henson,   for a General Foods Canada commercial. According to MacLean, the cookies are made using pancake mix, puffed rice, Grape Nuts, instant coffee, and water. But she told The Times that she uses glue to make the \"chocolate chips\" seen on the cookies. MacLean, who bakes the cookies at her own home, said in the interview that the cookies were \"kind of like a dog treat.\" She says she makes a fresh batch of around two dozen cookies ahead of each episode's filming. Rudman told The Times that MacLean's cookies are \"thin enough that it'll explode into a hundred crumbs\" but not \"too thin that it'll break in my hand when I'm holding it.\" A crumbling cookie, according to Rudman, is just what you need to elicit laughter from the audience. \"If he eats the cookie, and it only breaks into two pieces if it's too hard, it's just not funny. It looks almost painful,\" Rudman told The Times. \"But if he eats a cookie and it explodes into a hundred crumbs, that's where the comedy comes from,\" he continued.

{"title": "Are Edibles Actually Good for Sleep?", "author": null, "timestamp": null, "content": "bout 14% of U.S. adults   as of 2022, and research suggests many of them do so  . One   of cannabis users found that more than three-quarters of them thought they slept better thanks to the drug. But despite the popularity of using edibles for sleep, the data on how well they help people drift off are surprisingly mixed. Using edibles is “very helpful for some people,” says Deirdre Conroy, clinical director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at Michigan Medicine. But “for some people, it doesn’t help at all, and for others it works temporarily and then stops working.” Indeed, studies suggest some people—including those with  ,  , and  —get better rest when they use cannabis, perhaps because it helps quiet symptoms associated with those diagnoses. But other studies have found that marijuana helps people  , potentially because it  . Cannabis users are also more likely than non-users to  , research shows. And heavy and habitual users seem  , and may  . Studies looking specifically at edibles have yielded similarly mixed results. In the 2021 study in which most cannabis users said it helped their sleep, researchers found that edibles, specifically, were linked to shorter sleep duration and poorer overall sleep.   also found that teenagers who used edibles were more likely to get inadequate sleep than  , suggesting the way the drug is ingested may matter. But, on the flip side,   found that oral cannabis use helped people with chronic pain sleep, and   found that people with anxiety who took edibles felt they slept better when they did. Edibles tend to produce a longer-lasting effect than smoking marijuana, which may help some people fall and stay asleep through the night, the authors of the 2023 study wrote. People who used edibles high in  , reported particularly strong sleep. That makes sense, says Robert Welch, director of the National Center for Cannabis Research and Education at the University of Mississippi. People tend to think of cannabis products as all the same, but in reality, how a particular weed-infused gummy, drink, or food affects someone depends on the specific mixture of compounds within it. THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, makes some people feel energized and thus can interfere with sleep, particularly at higher doses. CBD, meanwhile, is more closely associated with sleep and relaxation; it seems to calm the central nervous system and boost levels of the sleep-promoting compound adenosine, Welch explains. Edibles that contain CBN, a byproduct of THC with mild sedative properties, are also often explicitly marketed as  , but there’s  . Even if someone does their homework, it’s hard to know exactly what’s in a given edible—especially if it comes from one of the many unregulated head shops springing up across the country, which aren’t subject to the same testing and production requirements as licensed dispensaries.   by Welch’s colleagues at the University of Mississippi found that, out of 25 CBD products sold in convenience stores, vape shops, and similar retailers, the content of only three came close to matching what their labels claimed. “You have zero idea what you’re getting,” Welch says—and thus, no reliable way to know how you’ll be affected. Even if labels are accurate, people respond to cannabis differently. The drug’s effects can vary depending on a person’s metabolism, other medications they’re taking, and even how much they’ve eaten that day, Welch says. Reactions are so individual, Conroy says, that personal experience matters just as much as what research shows—especially since marijuana is still illegal federally and in about half of U.S. states, which makes it difficult to study. “What we get in the science might be a bit different from the patient’s perspective, largely because the availability has outpaced the science,” she says. Negative research findings shouldn’t invalidate the experiences of people who benefit from using edibles for sleep, she says. Dr. Atul Malhotra, a sleep-medicine specialist at UC San Diego Health, says he doesn’t actively recommend that patients use edibles for sleep, largely because the science is so unsettled—but if someone is already doing so and feels it’s working well, he’s not overly concerned. “I usually fall in the category of, ‘If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it,’” Malhotra says. The most important thing to keep in mind, he says, is that if you feel you need an edible to sleep, that may be a red flag for a larger issue. Before popping gummies, Malhotra recommends getting your sleep hygiene in order, such as by limiting caffeine intake and  . If you have serious issues with insomnia or daytime fatigue, it may also be worth consulting a doctor to rule out issues like sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome. “There are plenty of people who self-medicate for those problems,” Malhotra says. “I would rather address the underlying cause as best I can.” Jamie Ducharme at  ."}
